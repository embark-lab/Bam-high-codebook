# Self-Report Measures

## Demographics

Demographics captured in the current study include: Race, Sexual
Orientation, Gender, Ethnicity, Student Status, Working Status, Current
Living Situation, Assessment Date, and Age

**Scoring**

Demographics are primarily drawn from the data collection form (measure
prefix 'dcf'). Cleaning steps include:

1.  Selection of variables that are part of the data collection form
    (prefix 'dcf') and winnow variables to be included in the master
    dataset.

2.  Calculation of age in years and remove birthdate (HIPPA Identifier)
    from the data set.

3.  Changing assessment date to only capture month and year of
    assessment for further de-identification.

4.  Binning categorical variables to response options most appropriate
    for race and ethnicity

**Key Variables**

`age` (Participant Age in Years)

`race` (Participant Race, recoded to: White[0], Black[1], Asian[2],
Mixed Race/Other[3])

`ethnicity` (Hispanic[1] or non-Hispanic[0])

`race_eth_1` (Race and ethnicity recoded to: White[0], Non-Hispanic
Black [1], Non-Hispanic Asian [2], Hispanic [3], Mixed/Other [4])

`race_eth_2` (Race and ethnicity recoded to: White [0], Asian [1], Other
[2])

`sex_orientation` (Participant sexual orientation, recoded to:
Heterosexual [0], Bi/Pansexual [1], Gay/Lesbian [2])

`sex_minority` (Participant sexual orientation recoded to
Hetersoxesual[0] or Sexual Minority[1])

`gender` (Participant gender identity recoded to Male[0], Female [1],
NonBinary/Other[2])

`gender_TNB` (Participant gender identity recoded to: Cisgender [0] or
Trans/Nonbinary [1])

`gender_female_nb` (Participant gender identity coded to Male = 0 and
Female/Nonbinary = 1)

`sex_gender_minority` (Participant sexual and gender identity coded to
CisHet [0] or Sexual/Gender Minority [1])

`assessment_month` (assessment recoded to assessment month and year)

## ED100k

ED100K.V3 questionnaire is a self-report, ED assessment based on the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, Eating
Disorders[@thorntonAnorexiaNervosaGenetics2018]. Items assess DSM-5
criteria for AN, BN, BED, and other specified feeding and eating
disorders (OSFED). The ED100K-V1 was found to be a valid measure of
eating disorders and eating disorder behaviors. Positive predictive
values for AN Criterion B, Criterion C, and binge eating ranged from 88
to 100% in the validation sample. Among women who had a negative screen,
the probability of not having these criteria or behaviors ranged from 72
to 100% in the validation sample. The correlation between questionnaire
and interview for lowest illness-related BMI was 0.91. Overall, the
questionnaire captures historical: eating disorder diagnosis, eating
disorder symptoms, eating disorder course of illness, and diagnostic
fluctuation within eating disorder diagnosis.

**Scoring**

Data cleaning steps include:

**1-2.** selects variables; recodes the compensatory exercise variable
to remove missing codes, and recodes intentional weight control
variables to remove missing codes and set '0' equal to a 'No/Never'
answer

**3.** overrides skip logic for exercise and other weight control
variables such that if individuals have an initial 'no' answer where
skip logic has overridden future questions, a '0' (reflecting a
'no/never' answer) is entered in the subsequent question regarding
details of the behavior.

**4.** Second recode for these questions such that missing codes are
change to 'NA' and the '0' answers are labelled appropriately

**5-7.** specifically calculate logic necessary to specify
exercise-related outcome variables, described in key variables below.

**8.** cleans up the dataset by removing erroneous variables that are no
longer needed.

After these steps ar complete, additional weight suppression variables
are calculated and added to the data in the R-script

## Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory

We used the 45-item Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory (EPSI;
[@forbushDevelopmentValidationEating2013]) to assess eating disorder
symptoms at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 8-week follow-up.
The EPSI has been validated in clinical, college, and community samples,
with 7-8 subscales in various populations, with the 8-subscale version
being the most commonly-employed version of the measure
[@coniglioFactorialIntegrityValidation2018]. The 8 subscales includ:
Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging,
Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and
Muscle Building. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (0
= Never; 4= Often) to describe how well each item describes the
participant experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across
the questions included in each subscale.

**Scoring**

Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (0 = Never; 4=
Often) to describe how well each item describes the participant
experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across the
questions included in each subscale. The eight subscales of the measure
are: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging,
Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and
Muscle Building.

**Key Variables**

All variables below reflect the final scoring of weighted subscale sum
scores with \< 25% missing data.

`epsi_body_dissatisfaction_25`

`epsi_binge_25` (binge eating)

`epsi_restraint_25`

`epsi_purging_25`

`epsi_restrict_25`

`epsi_exercise_25` (excessive exercise)

`epsi_neg_attitude_25` (negative attidtude towards obesity)

`epsi_muscle_building_25`

## Fat Phobia Scale - Short Form

The shortened Fat Phobia Scale (FPS) utilizes 14 questions to assess
fatphobia (from the 50-item original scale). It is intended to measure
fat phobia levels in the tested population through various personality
traits and whether there is bias when people apply them to an overweight
person (@baconFatPhobiaScale2001). The shortened FPS questionnaire
demonstrates high reliability when compared to the original 50 question
scale. The FPS uses a 5-point sliding scale with 1 being equal to a
different negative descriptive variable for each respective question and
5 being equal to a different positive variable for each respective
question. Some items are reverse scored prior to data aggregation such
that th 1 (negative) to 5 (positive) valuation is maintained across the
scale.

**Scoring**

Data Cleaning includes:

**1-2.** Selecting and renaming variables to include descriptive terms
from questions in the scale.

**3.** Coding all items such that the negative descriptor is labeled as
1 and the positive descriptor is labeled as 5.

**4.** Computing a mean score using all 14-items

**Key Variables**

`fps_mean` (Mean score of all 14 items)

## USDA Adult Food Security Survey Module (FSSM)

The U.S. Adult Food Security - Survey Module (FSSM)
[@carlsonMeasuringFoodInsecurity1999] was developed by the USDA Food and
Nutrition Services in 1995 for assessing food security within
households, specifically for use in the Current Population Survey. The
FSSM is primarily designed as a unidimensional, 10-item scale. Previous
use in college students indicates that students respond differently to
FSSM items relative to the general population, that the FSSM may be a
less reliable measure of food insecurity in college students relative to
other adults in the US population [@nikolausAreEstimatesFood2019], and
that there is potential for misclassification of FI college students
[@nikolausFoodInsecurityCollege2020], which is a note of caution when
interpreting findings from this measure in our young adult sample.
however, at present, there is no alternative measure of FI amongst
college students with a more robust track-record of validity.

Responses of "yes," "often," "sometimes," "almost every month," and
"some months but not every month" are coded as affirmative. The sum of
affirmative responses to the 10 questions in the Adult Food Security
Scale is then the raw score on the scale.

Food security status is assigned as follows: \| \| - Raw score 0: High
food security \| - Raw score 1-2: Marginal food security \| - Raw score
3-5: Low food security \| - Raw score 6-10: Very low food security \|
\|When dichotomizing, the food security status of the first two
categories in combination is described as food secure and the latter two
as food insecure.

**Scoring**

Data cleaning includes:

**1-2.** Select and rename variables to include numbering of questions
in the scale and name of scale being utilized

**3.** Recode scores in accordance with recommendations (noted above)

**4.** Create sum scores for dichotomized questions - `fssm_total`, and
average of frequency items `fssm_average_freq`.

**5.** Create Food Security Status variable - as outlined above

**Key Variables**

`fssm_total_25` (sum of 10-item FSSM, those with 25% or less missing -
weighted by N completed)

`fssm_average_freq_complete` (average of scores measuring how many days
were impacted by previous questions with yes no scores regarding
previous 28 days of access and measures taken because of food
insecurity - completers)

## Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7)

Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7)
[@spitzerBriefMeasureAssessing2006] is a seven-item instrument that is
used to measure or assess the severity of generalised anxiety disorder
(GAD). Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her
symptoms over the past two weeks. Response options include "not at all",
"several days", "more than half the days" and "nearly every day". The
GAD-7 is a widely-used and well-validated measure for anxiety screening
[@sapraUsingGeneralizedAnxiety2020]. the GAD-7 is scored on a
unidimensional scale summing all 7 items, with cutoffs that can also be
employed for interpretation of clinical severity: \| \| Minimal anxiety
= 0-4 \| Mild Anxiety = 5-9 \| Moderate Anxiety = 10-14 \| Severe
Anxiety = 15-21. \| \|

**Scoring**

The sum of the respondent's answers is used to generate an idea of the
respondent's anxiety level. A score of 10 points or higher indicates
probably anxiety disorder, with 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity for
GAD. We have also created a dichotomized measure of likely anxiety
(cutoff score of 10 or greater), along with clinical severity index
(minimal, mild, moderate, severe).

**Key variables**

`gad_sum_25` (Sum of GAD-7, 25% or less items missing and weighted by N
items completed)

`gad_cutoffs` (GAD-7 with anxiety severity cutoffs employed)

`gad_anx_disorder` (GAD-7 probable anxiety disorder Yes/No)

## Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale

The Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale (GFFS) is a 10-item scale which was
introduced in 1985 as a diagnostic tool to measure one's fear of fat as
it can be an indicator for the development of an eating disorder
[@goldfarbGoldfarbFearFat1985]. When used as a screening tool for both
clinical and non-clinical groups, GFFS has strong test-retest
reliability and psychometric properties
[@przybyta-basistaExaminationFactorStructure2022]. In addition, the test
also has shown high validity for both populations with and without
eating disorders (Goldfarb, 2010) While original factor structure is
defined as a single-factor,
@przybyta-basistaExaminationFactorStructure2022 also supported a
two-factor structure in a non-clinical sample: (1) fear of weight gain
and (2) fear of losing control over eating/weight.

**Scoring**

GFFS uses a 4-point scale with 1 being equal to very untrue and 4 being
equal to very true. The GFFS is scored by summing the items to create a
total score. The measure also contains two subscales (fear of weight
gain (FOWG) and loss of control (LOC) which can also be summed.

**Key Variables**

For variables below, \_25 appendix reflects that individuals with \<25%
missing items on a scale were included with weighted sums based on
number of items completed

`gffs_sum_25` (sum of all items)

`gffs_fowg_25` (sum of fear of weight gain subscale)

`gffs_loc_25` (sum of loss of control items)

**Key Variables**

## Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ)

The Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4 (SATAQ)
is designed to assess societal and interpersonal aspects of appearance
ideals. The SATAQ has five validated factors: Internalization of
Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization of Muscular/Athletic, Pressures from
Family, Pressures from Media, and Pressures from Peers. This scale
structure was confirmed in 3 independent and geographically diverse
samples of women from the United States (East Coast N = 440, West Coast
N = 304, and North/Midwest N = 349). SATAQ-4 scale scores demonstrated
excellent reliability and good convergent validity with measures of body
image, eating disturbance, and self-esteem. The measure was also
validated in college males from the United States (N = 271); however,
there was some evidence of an underlying structure unique to men. For
the purposes of the current data, the 5-factor structure is employed in
scoring.

**Scoring**

For the SATAQ, a total score is generated based on the mean of the
respondent's answers. Additionally, subscale scores (internalization of
thinness/low body fat, internalization of muscular/athletic. pressures -
family, pressures - peers, and pressures - media) are also calculated.

**Key Variables**

Variables with the \_25 appendix indicate that these variables include
those with 25% or less missing data

`sataq_mean_25` (mean of SATAQ)

`sataq_thin_ideal_25` (mean of internalization of the thin ideal)

`sataq_athletic_ideal_25` (mean of internalization of athletic ideal)

`sataq_parental_pressure_25` (mean of parental pressure)

`sataq_peer_pressure_25` (mean of peer pressure)

`sataq_media_pressure_25` (mean of media pressure)

## Traditional Masculinity-Femininity Scale (TMFS)

The Traditional Masculinity-Femininity Scale (TMFS) which was introduced
in 2016 to assess self-ascribed masculinity and femininity
[@kachelTraditionalMasculinityFemininity2016]. The TMFS has demonstrated
high reliability for both sexes. Additionally, TMFS shows validity due
to its ability to reduce issues of social desirability when given as a
self-assessment. TMFS uses a 7-point likert scale with 1 being equal to
totally masculine and 7 being equal to totally feminine. In terms of
scoring, the mean is taken of all given answers with an average less
than 4 implying masculinity and an average greater than 4 implying
femininity.

**Scoring**

The mean is taken of all given answers with an average less than 4
implying masculinity and an average greater than 4 implying femininity.

**Key Variables**

`tmfs_mean_25` (average of scores in response to questions asking about
different situations where one could consider their femininity and
masculinity. 25% or less missing data)
