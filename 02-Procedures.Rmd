# Procedures

The first wave of this study will include recruitment of 30 high school students (ages 13-18) to take part in an intervention to decrease weight stigma and fatphobia. We will aim to hold the intervention at three different timepoints with 10 participants in each round of the intervention. The intervention will either be held at the Wisconsin Psychiatry Institute and Clinic (WisPIC) or at the high schools in the Madison area. Participants will complete four facilitator-lead, 1-hour sessions, and complete a series of assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and at the conclusion of the final session and 1-month follow-up.
