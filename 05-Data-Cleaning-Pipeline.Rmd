The majority of our self-report measures (unless noted otherwise) are scored via the `scorekeeper` R package. All score sheets and R code for our data cleaning pipeline included in this study is available here (insert). You can replicate scoring procedures for a given measure by running the scorekeep function with raw data that matches characteristics of the raw data outlined in each score sheet. Below is information on measures included in this project and sorting procedures employed.
