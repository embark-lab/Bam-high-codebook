# Sample Description
For this study, we are recruiting a sample of 14-18 year olds who are currently enrolled in high school. We are hoping to recruit a sample that is representative of the high school population in Madison, WI in regards to race/ethnicity, gender, age, and sexual orientation. We are recruiting through outreach to high schools, community-based organizationst that work with teens, religious and cultural organizations, and local ED providers (both therapists and RDs). We are also posting flyers physically at local businesses, as well as online through a website called PeachJar (a platform that many local school districts use to distribute flyers) and on social media. 

[ONCE WE HAVE A SAMPLE WE CAN INCLUDE CORRECT FIGURES HERE] Among our participants, average fear of fatness at baseline was similar to samples of ‘repeat dieters’ (Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale average at Baseline = 23.26), but lower than clinical samples of those with active EDs. Our participants completed a measure of ED history, with questions specifically assessing ED diagnostic criteria. Among our participants, 60% reported history of symptoms consistent with a full-threshold ED diagnosis (AN = 33%, BN = 20%, BED = 7%) and an additional 20% reported a history of subthreshold symptoms (Driven exercise to lose weight = 13%, Subclinical BED = 7%).
