# Sample Description
For this study, we are recruiting a sample of 14-18 year olds who are currently enrolled in high school. We are hoping to recruit a sample that is representative of the high school population in Madison, WI in regards to race/ethnicity, gender, age, and sexual orientation. We are recruiting through outreach to high schools, community-based organizations that work with teens, religious and cultural organizations, and local ED providers (both therapists and RDs). We are also posting flyers physically at local businesses, as well as online through a website called PeachJar (a platform that many local school districts use to distribute flyers) and on social media.
