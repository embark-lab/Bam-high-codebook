METHOD: The \textregistered rst factor from the original fat phobia scale \DH{} undisciplined, inactive and unappealing \DH{} was identi\textregistered ed as a potential short form of the scale. A new sample of 255 people completed the original 50-item scale. The reliability of a shortened 14-item version of the scale was tested and compared to that of the full scale using both the new sample and the original sample of 1135 study participants. RESULTS: The fat phobia scale \DH{} short form demonstrated excellent reliability in both samples and was strongly correlated with the 50-item scale. Mean and 90th percentile scores are given for both the long and short versions of the scale. CONCLUSION: The shortened fat phobia scale is expected to increase the utility of the measure in a diverse array of research and clinical settings. Future research should focus on developing scale norms for the general population and conducting research on fat phobia in males and among different ethnic groups.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present initial findings on the validity of a recently developed maltreatment inventory, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), in a sample of adolescent psychiatric patients. METHOD: Three hundred ninety-eight male and female adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) admitted to the inpatient service of a private psychiatric hospital were given the CTQ as part of a larger test battery. Structured interviews were also conducted with the primary therapists of 190 of the patients to obtain ratings of abuse and neglect based on all available data, including clinical interviews with patients and their relatives and information from referring clinicians and agencies. RESULTS: Principal-components analysis of the CTQ items yielded five rotated factors-emotional abuse, emotional neglect, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and physical neglect-closely replicating the factor structure in an earlier study of adult patients. The internal consistency of the CTQ factors was extremely high both in the entire sample and in every subgroup examined. When CTQ factor scores were compared with therapists' ratings in a series of logistic regression analyses, relationships between the two sets of variables were highly specific, supporting the convergent and discriminant validity of the CTQ. Finally, when therapists' ratings were used as the validity criterion, the CTQ exhibited good sensitivity for all forms of maltreatment, and satisfactory or better levels of specificity. CONCLUSIONS: These initial findings suggest that the CTQ is a sensitive and valid screening questionnaire for childhood trauma in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient setting.},

  abstract = {Since 1992, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has led a collaborative effort to develop a comprehensive benchmark measure of the severity and prevalence of food insecurity and hunger in the United States. Based on prior research and wide consultation, a survey instrument specifically relevant to U.S. conditions was designed and tested. Through its Current Population Survey (CPS), the U.S. Bureau of the Census has fielded this instrument each year since 1995. A measurement scale was derived from the data through fitting, testing and validating a Rasch scale. The unidimensional Rasch model corresponds to the form of the phenomenon being measured, i.e., the severity of food insufficiency due to inadequate resources as directly experienced and reported in U.S. households. A categorical measure reflecting designated ranges of severity on the scale was constructed for consistent comparison of prevalence estimates over time and across population groups. The technical basis and initial results of the new measure were reported in September 1997. For the 12 months ending April 1995, an estimated 11.9\% of U.S. households (35 million persons) were food insecure. Among these, 4.1\% of households (with 6.9 million adults and 4.3 million children) showed a recurring pattern of hunger due to inadequate resources for one or more of their adult and/or child members sometime during the period. The new measure has been incorporated into other federal surveys and is being used by researchers throughout the U.S. and Canada.},

The current study represents the first external validation of the EPSI as well as the first to examine the factor structure in an outpatient eating disorder clinic sample. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis in three separate samples: an outpatient clinic sample (n\,=\,284), a college sample (n\,=\,296), and a community sample (n\,=\,341) and compared the observed factor structures to the original 8-factor solution proposed by Forbush et al. (2013). We also investigated whether the subscales correlated with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and a clinical impairment measure among the outpatient clinic sample. Results suggested between 7 and 8 factors for each of the three samples. Our findings largely replicated those of the original EPSI development study, excepting some deviations in the Muscle Building, Cognitive Restraint, and Excessive Exercise subscales. However, confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling produced poor model fit, which may be related to the item heterogeneity within many of the subscales. Finally, eating disorder attitudes and behaviors assessed by the EPSI were significantly correlated with the EDE-Q and with clinical impairment. Overall, our results highlight both strengths and limitations of the EPSI. Findings provide preliminary support for the use of the EPSI among research with diverse populations, and present several avenues for future research for enhancing clinical utility.},

Method: The PANAS was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,003). Competing models of the latent structure of the PANAS were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression and correlational analysis were used to determine the influence of demographic variables on PANAS scores as well as the relationship between the PANAS with measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the DASS). Results: The best-fitting model (robust comparative fit index = .94) of the latent structure of the PANAS consisted of two correlated factors corresponding to the PA and NA scales, and permitted correlated error between items drawn from the same mood subcategories (Zevon \& Tellegen, 1982). Demographic variables had only very modest influences on PANAS scores and the PANAS exhibited measurement invariance across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the PANAS was high, and the pattern of relationships between the PANAS and the DASS and HADS were consistent with tripartite theory. Conclusion: The PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess, although the hypothesis of complete independence between PA and NA must be rejected. The utility of this measure is enhanced by the provision of large-scale normative data.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study developed the Weight Bias Internalization Scale (WBIS), an 11-item measure assessing internalized weight bias among the overweight and obese. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: An Internet sample was recruited through online community discussion groups and snowball sampling via e-mail. Women (n = 164) and men (n = 34) with a BMI {$>$} 25 kg/m2 completed the WBIS and the Antifat Attitudes Questionnaire (AAQ), as well as measures of self-esteem, body image, mood disturbance, drive for thinness, and binge eating. RESULTS: Results indicate that the WBIS had high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.90) and correlated significantly with antifat attitudes but was not a completely overlapping construct (r = 0.31). The scale showed strong partial correlations with self-esteem (r = -0.67), drive for thinness (r = 0.47), and body image concern (r = 0.75), controlling for BMI. Internalized weight bias was also significantly correlated with measures of mood and eating disturbance. Multiple regression analyses were conducted using WBIS scores, antifat attitudes, and BMI as predictor variables of body image, mood, self-esteem, and binge eating. WBIS scores were found to significantly predict scores on each of these measures. DISCUSSION: The WBIS showed excellent psychometric properties and construct validity. The study highlights the importance of distinguishing antifat attitudes toward others from internalized weight bias, a construct that may be closely linked with psychopathology.},

Household fit indices are used to examine the psychometric quality of household-level measures of food insecurity. In the United States, measures of food insecurity are commonly obtained from the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM, 18 items) of the Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement (CPS-FSS). These measures, in various forms, are used to inform national programs and policies related to food insecurity. Data for low-income households with children from recent administrations of the HFSSM (2012-2014) are used in this study (N = 7,324). The results suggest that there are detectable levels of misfit with Infit mean square error (MSE) statistics ranging from 6.73 \% to 21.33\% and Outfit MSE statistics ranging from 5.31\% to 9.68\%. The data suggest for Outfit MSE statistics that (a) male respondents, (b) respondents with lower levels of education, and (c) respondents who did not report participating in SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly the Food Stamp Program) tend to have more misfit. For Infit MSE statistics, lack of homeownership appears to be a predictor of misfit. The implications of this research for future research, theory, and policy related to the measurement of household food insecurity are discussed.},

The goal of this study was to overcome these limitations through the development of a comprehensive multidimensional measure of eating pathology. An initial pool of 160 items was developed to assess 20 dimensions of eating pathology. The initial item pool was administered to a student sample (N = 433) and community sample (N = 407) to determine the preliminary structure of the measure using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The revised measure was administered to independent samples of patients recruited from specialty ED treatment centers (N = 158), outpatient psychiatric clinics (N = 303), and students (N = 227). Analyses revealed an 8-factor structure characterized by Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Excessive Exercise, Restricting, Purging, Muscle Building, and Negative Attitudes Toward Obesity. Scale scores showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity; other analyses demonstrated that the majority of scales were invariant across sex and weight categories. Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory scale scores had excellent internal consistency (median coefficient alphas ranged from .84\textendash.89) and reliability over a 2- to 4-week period (mean retest r = .73). The current study represents one of the most comprehensive scale development projects ever conducted in the field of EDs and will enhance future basic and treatment research focused on EDs.

  abstract = {Gender stereotype theory suggests that men are generally perceived as more masculine than women, whereas women are generally perceived as more feminine than men. Several scales have been developed to measure fundamental aspects of gender stereotypes (e.g., agency and communion, competence and warmth, or instrumentality and expressivity). Although omitted in later version, Bem's original Sex Role Inventory included the items ``masculine'' and ``feminine'' in addition to more specific gender-stereotypical attributes. We argue that it is useful to be able to measure these two core concepts in a reliable, valid, and parsimonious way. We introduce a new and brief scale, the Traditional Masculinity-Femininity (TMF) scale, designed to assess central facets of self-ascribed masculinity-femininity. Studies 1\textendash 2 used known-groups approaches (participants differing in gender and sexual orientation) to validate the scale and provide evidence of its convergent validity. As expected the TMF reliably measured a one-dimensional masculinity-femininity construct. Moreover, the TMF correlated moderately with other gender-related measures. Demonstrating incremental validity, the TMF predicted gender and sexual orientation in a superior way than established adjective-based measures. Furthermore, the TMF was connected to criterion characteristics, such as judgments as straight by laypersons for the whole sample, voice pitch characteristics for the female subsample, and contact to gay men for the male subsample, and outperformed other gender-related scales. Taken together, as long as gender differences continue to exist, we suggest that the TMF provides a valuable methodological addition for research into gender stereotypes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {$>$} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

We found strong support for a five-factor EFQ consisting of subscales assessing fear of weight gain, social consequences, personal consequences, physical sensations, and social eating. We found strong support for a six-factor EFI consisting of subscales assessing fear of food, weight gain, physical sensations, personal consequences, social consequences, and exercise-related fears. Both measures had adequate to strong internal consistency and convergent, divergent, incremental, and construct validity. These measures can be used to identify ED fears that can be targeted in personalized treatment. These data show that ED fears are multifaceted and heterogeneous.},

However, these rates vary dramatically across institutions and studies. FI assessment methods commonly used in studies with college students have not been scrutinized for psychometric properties, and varying protocols may influence resulting FI prevalence estimates. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of standard food security assessment protocols and to evaluate their agreement as well as the relative accuracy of these protocols in identifying student FI. A randomized sample of 4,000 undergraduate students were invited to participate in an online survey (Qualtrics, LLC, Provo, Utah, USA) that evaluated sociodemographic characteristics and FI with the 2-item food sufficiency screener and the 10-item USDA Adult Food Security Survey Module (FSSM; containing the abbreviated 6-item module). Four hundred sixty-two eligible responses were included in the final sample. The psychometric analysis revealed inconsistencies in college student response patterns on the FSSM when compared to national evaluations. Agreement between FI protocols was generally high ({$>$}90\%) but was lessened when compared with a protocol that incorporated the 2-item screener. The 10-item FSSM with the 2-item screener had the best model fit (McFadden's R2 = 0.15 and Bayesian Information Criterion = -2049.72) and emerged as the tool providing the greatest relative accuracy for identifying students with FI. Though the 10-item FSSM and 2-item screener yields the most accuracy in this sample, it is unknown why students respond to FSSM items differently than the general population. Further qualitative and quantitative evaluations are needed to determine which assessment protocol is the most valid and reliable for use in accurately identifying FI in post-secondary students across the U.S.},

  abstract = {Reports of college students experiencing food insecurity (FI), defined as inadequate access, availability, adequacy, and stability of food, have sparked national calls for alleviation and prevention policies. However, there are a wide variety of FI rates reported across studies and even among recent literature reviews. The current scoping review aimed to develop a weighted estimated prevalence of FI among US students using a comprehensive search approach. In addition, study characteristics that may be related to the high variability in reported FI prevalence were explored. To address these aims, the peer-reviewed and gray literature on US college student FI was systematically searched to identify 12,044 nonduplicated records. A total of 51 study samples, across 62 records, met inclusion criteria and were included in the current review. The quality of the included studies was moderate, with an average rate of 6.4 on a scale of 0\textendash 10. Convenience (45\%) and census (30\%) sampling approaches were common; only 4 study samples were based on representative sampling strategies. FI estimates ranged from 10\% to 75\%. It was common for very low security to be as prevalent as, or more prevalent than, low food security. The surveying protocols used in the studies were related to the FI estimates. The USDA Short Form Food Security Survey Module (FSSM; 50\%) and the USDA Adult FSSM (40\%) prevalence estimates were larger than for the full USDA Household FSSM (13\%). When these surveys referenced a 12-mo period, FI estimates were 31\%. This was a lower FI estimate than surveys using reference periods of 9 mo or shorter (47\%). The results indicate that FI is a pressing issue among college students, but the variation in prevalence produced by differing surveys suggests that students may be misclassified with current surveying methods. Psychometric testing of these surveys when used with college students is warranted.},

Students are unable to acquire adequate food to meet their needs because of limited money, time, transportation, and other factors. However, food insecurity rates are almost always assessed by using the USDA's food security survey module, which frames the barriers to food access as purely financial by relying entirely on items that explicitly ask about a financial barrier to food security, rather than any other possible barriers. Using survey and interview data collected in collaboration with our campus food pantry and undergraduate student researchers from 2015 to 2019, we show that student food insecurity is a result of complex factors that go beyond financial limitations. We argue that the USDA measure is insufficient for fully assessing the prevalence of college student food insecurity because it presupposes a financial cause for food insecurity and then undercounts those who are food insecure for other reasons.},

Methods A web-based survey was completed by 4,732 1st year medical students from 49 medical schools as part of a longitudinal study of medical education. The survey included a validated measure of implicit weight bias, the implicit association test, and 2 measures of explicit bias: a feeling thermometer and the anti-fat attitudes test. Results A majority of students exhibited implicit (74\%) and explicit (67\%) weight bias. Implicit weight bias scores were comparable to reported bias against racial minorities. Explicit attitudes were more negative toward obese people than toward racial minorities, gays, lesbians, and poor people. In multivariate regression models, implicit and explicit weight bias was predicted by lower BMI, male sex, and non-Black race. Either implicit or explicit bias was also predicted by age, SES, country of birth, and specialty choice. Conclusions Implicit and explicit weight bias is common among 1st year medical students, and varies across student factors. Future research should assess implications of biases and test interventions to reduce their impact.},

This issue has not yet been investigated in the literature. Data were collected from 126 female patients diagnosed with ED and a total of 581 women from the general population. Our findings are highly consistent with the original single-factor structure of GFFS but only in the clinical sample. In the non-clinical sample, a good fit to the data has been achieved with a two-factor model composed of Fear of gaining weight and Fear of losing control over eating/weight. The Polish version of GFFS demonstrated good psychometric properties. It can be used as a fast screening tool to identify individuals with eating disorders and those at risk of developing such disorders. We recommend the two-factor model for non-clinical samples and the one-dimensional model for clinical samples for both research and practice.},

In the current investigation, the SATAQ-3 was revised to improve upon some conceptual limitations and was evaluated in 4 U.S. and 3 international female samples, as well as a U.S. male sample. In Study 1, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses for a sample of women from the Southeastern United States (N = 859) indicated a 22-item scale with 5 factors: Internalization: Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization: Muscular/Athletic, Pressures: Family, Pressures: Media, Pressures: Peers. This scale structure was confirmed in 3 independent and geographically diverse samples of women from the United States (East Coast N = 440, West Coast N = 304, and North/Midwest N = 349). SATAQ-4 scale scores demonstrated excellent reliability and good convergent validity with measures of body image, eating disturbance, and self-esteem. Study 2 replicated the factorial validity, reliability, and convergent validity of the SATAQ-4 in an international sample of women drawn from Italy, England, and Australia (N = 362).

The current study sought to address limitations of the scale in order to increase precision in the measurement of muscular ideal internalization, include an assessment of one's desire for attractiveness, and broaden the measurement of appearance-related pressures. METHOD: The factor structure, reliability and construct validity of the SATAQ-4-Revised were examined among college women (N\,=\,1,114) in Study 1, adolescent girls (N\,=\,275) in Study 2, and college men (N\,=\,290) in Study 3. RESULTS: Factor analysis among college women indicated a 7-factor 31-item scale, labeled the SATAQ-4R-Female: (1) Internalization: Thin/Low Body Fat, (2) Internalization: Muscular, (3) Internalization: General Attractiveness, (4) Pressures: Family, (5) Pressures: Media, (6) Pressures: Peers, and (7) Pressures: Significant Others. SATAQ-4R-Female subscales demonstrated good reliability and construct validity among college women. Examination of the SATAQ-4R-Female among adolescent girls suggested a six-factor scale in which peer and significant others items comprised a single subscale. The scale demonstrated good reliability and construct validity in adolescent girls. Examination of the SATAQ-4R among men produced a 28-item scale with seven factors paralleling the factors identified among college women. This scale, labeled the SATAQ-4R-Male, demonstrated good reliability and construct validity. DISCUSSION: Results support the reliability and validity of SATAQ-4R-Female in college women and adolescent girls, and the SATAQ-4R-Male in college men. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.(Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:104-117).},

The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity.A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use.A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89\%) and specificity (82\%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale.The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.Arch Intern Med. 2006;166:1092-1097--{$>$}},

Method 680 young women (M age = 22.2, SD = 7.1) recruited at colleges in 2 states were randomized to clinician-led Body Project groups, peer-led Body Project groups, the Internet-based eBody Project or an educational video control condition. Results Participants in all three variants of the Body Project intervention showed significantly greater reductions in eating disorder risk factors and symptoms than educational video controls. Participants in clinician-led and peer-led Body Project groups showed significantly greater reductions in risk factors than eBody Project participants, but effects for the two types of groups were similar. Eating disorder onset over 7-month follow-up was significantly lower for peer-led Body Project group participants versus eBody Project participants (2.2\% vs. 8.4\%), but did not differ significantly between other conditions. Conclusions The evidence that all three dissonance-based prevention programs outperformed an educational video condition, that both group-based interventions outperformed the Internet-based intervention in risk factor reductions, and that the peer-led groups showed lower eating disorder onset over follow-up than the Internet-based intervention is novel. These acute-effects data suggest that both group-based interventions produce superior eating disorder prevention effects than the Internet-based intervention and that delivery can be task-shifted to peer leaders.},

As hypothesized, effects were larger for interventions with more dissonance-inducing activities, more group sessions, and larger group sizes, as well as when delivered in-person versus on-line, sessions were recorded, participation was voluntary, body dissatisfaction was required, participants were mid-adolescents or adults (versus older adolescence), there were more ethnic minority participants, groups were led by clinicians versus researchers and at least two facilitators, and when facilitators received more training and supervision. Unexpectedly from a dissonance-induction perspective, effects were larger when participants were compensated. Results offer directions for maximizing the benefits of implementation efforts with dissonancebased eating disorder prevention programs, and may hold lessons for preventing other public health problems with dissonance-based interventions.},

  abstract = {Tested an integrative model of bulimia that centers around dietary restraint and affect regulation pathways and incorporates perceived sociocultural pressure, body-mass, ideal-body internalization (IBI), and body dissatisfaction (BD). Using data from 257 female undergraduates (aged 17-52 yrs), structural equation modeling revealed that the model accounted for 71\% of the variance in bulimic symptomatology. Results provide consistent support for the dual pathway model of bulimia nervosa. Body mass was positively related to perceived pressure for a thin body and BD. Perceived pressure was related to BD both directly and indirectly through IBI. Also, significant paths were found from BD to bulimic symptomatology through both dietary restraint and negative affect, and dietary restraint predicted negative affect. Prevention programs focusing on IBI, BD, restraint, and negative affect in middle schools could reduce the prevalence of bulimia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Background Genetic factors contribute to anorexia nervosa (AN); and the first genome-wide significant locus has been identified. We describe methods and procedures for the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI), an international collaboration designed to rapidly recruit 13,000 individuals with AN and ancestrally matched controls. We present sample characteristics and the utility of an online eating disorder diagnostic questionnaire suitable for large-scale genetic and population research. Methods ANGI recruited from the United States (US), Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Sweden (SE), and Denmark (DK). Recruitment was via national registers (SE, DK); treatment centers (US, ANZ, SE, DK); and social and traditional media (US, ANZ, SE). All cases had a lifetime AN diagnosis based on DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria (excluding amenorrhea). Recruited controls had no lifetime history of disordered eating behaviors. To assess the positive and negative predictive validity of the online eating disorder questionnaire (ED100K-v1), 109 women also completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Module H. Results Blood samples and clinical information were collected from 13,363 individuals with lifetime AN and from controls. Online diagnostic phenotyping was effective and efficient; the validity of the questionnaire was acceptable. Conclusions Our multi-pronged recruitment approach was highly effective for rapid recruitment and can be used as a model for efforts by other groups. High online presence of individuals with AN rendered the Internet/social media a remarkably effective recruitment tool in some countries. ANGI has substantially augmented Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN sample collection. ANGI is a registered clinical trial: clinicaltrials.govNCT01916538; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01916538?cond=Anorexia+Nervosa\&draw=1\&rank=3.},

Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) indicated a poor fit between our data and the instrument's established 5-factor structure. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) yielded four stable and usable factors corresponding to the Emotional Abuse, Emotional Neglect, Physical Abuse, and Sexual Abuse subscales of the CTQ; the Physical Neglect subscale did not emerge as a stable factor. Cross loading of many CTQ items onto more than one factor most likely produced the poor CFA fit, and indicated that abuse/neglect constructs were not conceptually distinct for our sample. Mean trauma scores did not differ significantly from published scores for female substance abusers. According to the CTQ Minimization/Denial scale, 42\% of participants minimized their childhood maltreatment experiences. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods may be optimal for the acquisition of sensitive trauma information with wary and vulnerable street populations.},

A number of mood scales have been created to measure these factors; however, many existing measures are inadequate, showing low reliability or poor convergent or discriminant validity. To fill the need for reliable and valid Positive Affect and Negative Affect scales that are also brief and easy to administer, we developed two 10-item mood scales that comprise the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The scales are shown to be highly internally consistent, largely uncorrelated, and stable at appropriate levels over a 2-month time period. Normative data and factorial and external evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the scales are also presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

The Three-Factor Model of Dieting suggests that dieting can be subdivided into three types: (1) frequency of past dieting and overeating (i.e., history of dieting), (2) current dieting to lose weight, and (3) weight suppression, or the difference between an individual's current weight and his or her highest previous weight. The purpose of this paper is to (1) describe the Dieting and Weight History Questionnaire (DWHQ), a measure that we have used for many years to assess these three dimensions of dieting; (2) provide some recent examples of published research on each type of dieting; (3) discuss some of the nuances of assessing these dieting types; and (4) suggest directions for future research.},
