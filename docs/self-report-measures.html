<p>The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) is a standardized self-report inventory that measures the severity of childhood trauma and participants’ tendency to underreport maltreatment, and has been validated in both clinical and non-clinical populations <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bernsteinValidityChildhoodTrauma1997" role="doc-biblioref">Bernstein et al., 1997</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-villanoPsychometricUtilityChildhood2004" role="doc-biblioref">Villano et al., 2004</a>)</span>. The CTQ is a retrospective 28-item self-report inventory that measures the severity of different types of childhood trauma, producing five clinical subscales each comprised of five items: Emotional Abuse, Physical Abuse, Sexual Abuse, Emotional Neglect, Physical Neglect. The measure also includes a three-item Minimization/Denial scale indicating the potential underreporting of maltreatment. Participants respond to each item in the context of “when you were growing up” and answer according to a five-point Likert scale ranging from “never” = 1 to “very often” = 5, producing scores of 5 to 25 for each trauma subscale. The three items comprising the Minimization/Denial scale are dichotomized (“never” = 0, all other responses = 1) and summed; a total of one (1) or greater suggests the possible underreporting of maltreatment (false negatives).</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Scoring for the CTQ includes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<p>The Eating Disorder History Questionnaire was developed by the EMBARK Lab for the current project to assess eating disorder history in the sample. It was used in baseline assessment for the current project prior to September, 2022, at which point the ED100k was substituted as it has been supported through initial validation for this purpose. The Eating Disorder History Questionnaire follows diagnostic algorithmic scoring to assess (via self-report) for history of eating disorder behaviors along with DSM-5 Anorexia Nervosa, Atypical Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder, and Subclinical Eating Pathology.</p>

<p>ED100K.V3 questionnaire is a self-report, ED assessment based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, Eating Disorders<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-thorntonAnorexiaNervosaGenetics2018" role="doc-biblioref">Thornton et al., 2018</a>)</span>. Items assess DSM-5 criteria for AN, BN, BED, and other specified feeding and eating disorders (OSFED). The ED100K-V1 was found to be a valid measure of eating disorders and eating disorder behaviors. Positive predictive values for AN Criterion B, Criterion C, and binge eating ranged from 88 to 100% in the validation sample. Among women who had a negative screen, the probability of not having these criteria or behaviors ranged from 72 to 100% in the validation sample. The correlation between questionnaire and interview for lowest illness-related BMI was 0.91. Overall, the questionnaire captures historical: eating disorder diagnosis, eating disorder symptoms, eating disorder course of illness, and diagnostic fluctuation within eating disorder diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Data cleaning steps include:</p>
<p><strong>1-2.</strong> selects variables; recodes the compensatory exercise variable to remove missing codes, and recodes intentional weight control variables to remove missing codes and set ‘0’ equal to a ‘No/Never’ answer</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> overrides skip logic for exercise and other weight control variables such that if individuals have an initial ‘no’ answer where skip logic has overridden future questions, a ‘0’ (reflecting a ‘no/never’ answer) is entered in the subsequent question regarding details of the behavior.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Second recode for these questions such that missing codes are change to ‘NA’ and the ‘0’ answers are labelled appropriately</p>
<p><strong>5-7.</strong> specifically calculate logic necessary to specify exercise-related outcome variables, described in key variables below.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> cleans up the dataset by removing erroneous variables that are no longer needed.</p>
<p>After these steps ar complete, additional weight suppression variables are calculated and added to the data in the R-script</p>

<p>The EDFQ is a self-report measure of eating disorder specific fears, which was developed and validated in undergraduate college students along with a clinical sample of eating disorder patients by <span class="citation">Levinson et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-levinsonDevelopmentValidationEating2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. A five-factor strucutre for the EDFQ was established, consisting of subscales assessing fear of weight gain, social consequences, personal consequences, physical sensations, and social eating.

<p>We used the 45-item Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory (EPSI; <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-forbushDevelopmentValidationEating2013" role="doc-biblioref">Forbush et al., 2013</a>)</span>) to assess eating disorder symptoms at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 8-week follow-up. The EPSI has been validated in clinical, college, and community samples, with 7-8 subscales in various populations, with the 8-subscale version being the most commonly-employed version of the measure <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-coniglioFactorialIntegrityValidation2018" role="doc-biblioref">Coniglio et al., 2018</a>)</span>. The 8 subscales includ: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (0 = Never; 4= Often) to describe how well each item describes the participant experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across the questions included in each subscale.</p>

<p>The shortened Fat Phobia Scale (FPS) utilizes 14 questions to assess fatphobia (from the 50-item original scale). It is intended to measure fat phobia levels in the tested population through various personality traits and whether there is bias when people apply them to an overweight person (<span class="citation">Bacon et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-baconFatPhobiaScale2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>). The shortened FPS questionnaire demonstrates high reliability when compared to the original 50 question scale. The FPS uses a 5-point sliding scale with 1 being equal to a different negative descriptive variable for each respective question and 5 being equal to a different positive variable for each respective question. Some items are reverse scored prior to data aggregation such that th 1 (negative) to 5 (positive) valuation is maintained across the scale.</p>

<p>The U.S. Adult Food Security - Survey Module (FSSM) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-carlsonMeasuringFoodInsecurity1999" role="doc-biblioref">Carlson et al., 1999</a>)</span> was developed by the USDA Food and Nutrition Services in 1995 for assessing food security within households, specifically for use in the Current Population Survey. The FSSM is primarily designed as a unidimensional, 10-item scale. Previous use in college students indicates that students respond differently to FSSM items relative to the general population, that the FSSM may be a less reliable measure of food insecurity in college students relative to other adults in the US population <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-nikolausAreEstimatesFood2019" role="doc-biblioref">Nikolaus et al., 2019</a>)</span>, and that there is potential for misclassification of FI college students <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-nikolausFoodInsecurityCollege2020" role="doc-biblioref">Nikolaus et al., 2020</a>)</span>, which is a note of caution when interpreting findings from this measure in our young adult sample. however, at present, there is no alternative measure of FI amongst college students with a more robust track-record of validity.</p>
<p>Responses of “yes,” “often,” “sometimes,” “almost every month,” and “some months but not every month” are coded as affirmative. The sum of affirmative responses to the 10 questions in the Adult Food Security Scale is then the raw score on the scale.</p>
<p>Food security status is assigned as follows:
|
| - Raw score 0: High food security
| - Raw score 1-2: Marginal food security
| - Raw score 3-5: Low food security
| - Raw score 6-10: Very low food security
|
|When dichotomizing, the food security status of the first two categories in combination is described as food secure and the latter two as food insecure.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Data cleaning includes:</p>
<p><strong>1-2.</strong> Select and rename variables to include numbering of questions in the scale and name of scale being utilized</p>

The GAD-7 is a widely-used and well-validated measure for anxiety screening <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-sapraUsingGeneralizedAnxiety2020" role="doc-biblioref">Sapra et al., 2020</a>)</span>. the GAD-7 is scored on a unidimensional scale summing all 7 items, with cutoffs that can also be employed for interpretation of clinical severity:
|
| Minimal anxiety = 0-4
| Mild Anxiety = 5-9
| Moderate Anxiety = 10-14
| Severe Anxiety = 15-21.
|
| A score of 10 points or higher indicates probably anxiety disorder, with 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity for GAD.</p>

</h2>
<p>The Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale (GFFS) is a 10-item scale which was introduced in 1985 as a diagnostic tool to measure one’s fear of fat as it can be an indicator for the development of an eating disorder <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-goldfarbGoldfarbFearFat1985" role="doc-biblioref">Goldfarb et al., 1985</a>)</span>. When used as a screening tool for both clinical and non-clinical groups, GFFS has strong test-retest reliability and psychometric properties <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-przybyta-basistaExaminationFactorStructure2022" role="doc-biblioref">Przybyta-Basista et al., 2022</a>)</span>. In addition, the test also has shown high validity for both populations with and without eating disorders (Goldfarb, 2010) While original factor structure is defined as a single-factor, <span class="citation">Przybyta-Basista et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-przybyta-basistaExaminationFactorStructure2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> also supported a two-factor structure in a non-clinical sample: (1) fear of weight gain and (2) fear of losing control over eating/weight. GFFS uses a 4-point scale with 1 being equal to very untrue and 4 being equal to very true</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Data Cleaning includes:</p>
<p><strong>1-2.</strong> Select and rename variables; recode labels scale to begin at 0 instead of 1 with very untrue being equal to 0 and very true being equal to 3.</p>
<p><strong>3-4.</strong> Sum the total scores and create a variable to reflect only those completing &gt; 75% of items. Also create two subscales (FOWG and Fear of LOC) for alternative scoring.</p>
<p>|<strong>Scoring Note</strong> Our GFFS scoring procedure re-scales the item scores to be 0-3 instead of 1-4, meaning that sum scores are scaled 0-21 instead of 7-28. To compare our means to other studies using the GFFS, add 7 to the sum score.</p>

<p>The Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4 (SATAQ) is designed to assess societal and interpersonal aspects of appearance ideals. The SATAQ has five validated factors: Internalization of Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization of Muscular/Athletic, Pressures from Family, Pressures from Media, and Pressures from Peers. This scale structure was confirmed in 3 independent and geographically diverse samples of women from the United States (East Coast N = 440, West Coast N = 304, and North/Midwest N = 349). SATAQ-4 scale scores demonstrated excellent reliability and good convergent validity with measures of body image, eating disturbance, and self-esteem. The measure was also validated in college males from the United States (N = 271); however, there was some evidence of an underlying structure unique to men. For the purposes of the current data, the 5-factor structure is employed in scoring.</p>

</h2>
<p>This companion file is for the Universal Measure of Bias - Fat (UMB-Fat) which was introduced in 2008 to assess weight bias and demonstrates strong psychometric properties when utilized as an assessment <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-dursoUnderstandingSelfdirectedStigma2008" role="doc-biblioref">Durso &amp; Latner, 2008</a>)</span>. It has been compared alongside two other scales measuring universal bias against ‘gay’ or ‘Muslim’ individuals and demonstrates high internal consistency and construct validity <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-latnerWeighingObesityStigma2008" role="doc-biblioref">Latner et al., 2008</a>)</span>. Further, higher BMI is not associated with any differences in weight bias. The UMB-Fat uses a 7-point likert scale with 1 being equal to strongly agree and 7 being equal to strongly disagree. In terms of scoring, sums of scores are separated amongst four categories of bias: adverse judgement, social distance, attraction, and equal rights.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Data cleaning includes:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Selecting and renaming variables to include descriptors of questions asked in the scale</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Reverse coding questions 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, and 19 so that higher scores indicate greater stigma</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Creation of subscale scores:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sum the total scores of questions 5, 7, 12 ,15 , 16 = <code>umb_adverse_judgement_sum</code></p></li>
<li><p>Sum the total scores of questions 2, 8, 17, 19, 20 = <code>umb_social_distance_sum</code></p></li>
