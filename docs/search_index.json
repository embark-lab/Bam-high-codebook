While existing, dissonance programs (i.e. the Body Project) target reductions in thin-ideal internalization, fears related to fatness and weight gain may be a particularly salient cognitive target among those with current or past eating disorder symptomatology (Levinson et al., 2014). In an effort to mitigate risk for ED onset and relapse among high-risk young adults (i.e. those in ED partial- or full-remission and/or those with ongoing subthreshold ED symptoms), the current project includes development and initial evaluation of a novel, peer-led intervention that focuses specifically on fear of fatness and anti-fat bias (the Body Advocacy Movement; BAM). This project aims to recruit 60 young adults (ages 18-26) – randomized to a standard dissonance intervention program (the Body Project; N = 20) or BAM (N = 40). Our objective is to examine the degree to which BAM can reduce fear of fatness and weight gain along with internalized anti-fat bias and reduce risk for ED symptom exacerbation and promote ongoing ED recovery in a high-risk, young adult sample. We will evaluate feasibility and acceptability of BAM and estimate effects of the intervention on self-report and behavioral measures of fear of weight gain and fatness, anti-fat bias, and eating disorder symptoms. We will conduct initial effect size comparisons with the Body Project to determine whether BAM shows potency in specifically targeting fear of fatness and anti-fat bias. 1.1 Specific Aims Aim 1: Examine the acceptability and feasibility of BAM in a high-risk young adult sample. Acceptability: Acceptability will be assessed via attrition across a 4-session intervention along with qualitative feedback from a brief survey at post-intervention. We expect to meet benchmarks of high acceptability (average ratings of &gt; 4 [out of 5] on post-intervention survey; &lt; 20% attrition). Feasibility: Feasibility will be benchmarked via intervention adherence (average competency &gt; 8.0 on 0-10 scale) and recruitment goals. Aim 2: Estimate the effects of the intervention on fear of fatness, anti-fat bias, and eating disorder symptoms. We hypothesize that the BAM intervention will result in acute reductions (post-intervention) in fatphobia and anti-fat bias across self—report and behavioral measures, outperforming the Body Project on targets related to anti-fat bias, specifically.

Participants will be randomized to the Body Project (n = 20) or BAM (n = 40). Participants in both groups will complete two peer-led, 2-hour sessions, and complete a series of assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and at 1-month and 6-month follow-up. 2.1 Recruitment Recruitment sources include: (1) University Health Services at UW-Madison and other area colleges and universities (2) flyers at area businesses (e.g. fitness centers, coffee shops) (3) online advertisement on social media platforms (4) direct, peer-to-peer recruitment by peer facilitators, (5) campus e-mail recruitment.

Participants in BAM will (1) Define anti-fat bias and fatphobia and explore how these constructs manifest in personal beliefs and interpersonal interactions, (2) Engage in imaginal exposure exercises to challenge fears related to fatness and weight gain (3) Reflect on how fears of fatness align with personal values, (4) Learn new ways to challenge fear of fatness and internalized anti-fat bias and (5) Discuss ways to challenge anti-fat bias on an institutional and societal level. Intervention content. 3.2.1 Session 1 Session 1 includes introductions, discussing identities and clarifying terminology, and an exercise in defining anti-fat bias and fatphobia. Participants will be asked to complete an imaginal exposure exercise several times during the week in which they will write and then recount a ‘worst-case scenario’ of what they might fear could happen if they gained a significant amount of weight. 3.2.2 Session 2 Session 2 includes debriefing the exposure homework and identification of ways one might uproot internalized fear of fatness, along with a series of role plays in which peer facilitators will play the role of a friend or family member in a situation that evokes anti-fat attitudes, and participants will practice challenging these attitudes. Participants will also identify ways to challenge anti-fat bias in society and commit to engaging in one activity to do so in the coming week. As an exit exercise, they will write a ‘response letter’ to their worst-case scenario. 3.3 Peer Facilitators We will employ a peer-facilitated model of group intervention in this program, where a small group of 6-10 facilitators will undergo an 8-hour training program, similar to Stice et al. (2017). Peer facilitators will train in teams – each peer-leader team will role-play delivery of the entire intervention and observed other peer leaders teams do the same, receiving live clinical supervision. 3.4 Intervention Fidelity Sessions will be audio recorded and reviewed by two members of research staff. Audio recorded sessions will be rated for fidelity and competence. Research staff will independently code a randomly selected sample of 50% of sessions for implementation fidelity and facilitator competence using checklists assessing the major exercises and discussion topics for each session. Each component will be rated for degree of accurate presentation (10-point scale from “No adherence; the section was skipped” to “Perfect; all material in the section was presented as written”). Facilitator competence will be rated using 12 items assessing indicators of competence (e.g., leaders express ideas clearly and at an appropriate pace, leaders attempt to allot equal speaking time for all members) on a 10-point scale.

The CTQ is a retrospective 28-item self-report inventory that measures the severity of different types of childhood trauma, producing five clinical subscales each comprised of five items: Emotional Abuse, Physical Abuse, Sexual Abuse, Emotional Neglect, Physical Neglect. The measure also includes a three-item Minimization/Denial scale indicating the potential underreporting of maltreatment. Participants respond to each item in the context of “when you were growing up” and answer according to a five-point Likert scale ranging from “never” = 1 to “very often” = 5, producing scores of 5 to 25 for each trauma subscale. The three items comprising the Minimization/Denial scale are dichotomized (“never” = 0, all other responses = 1) and summed; a total of one (1) or greater suggests the possible underreporting of maltreatment (false negatives). Scoring Scoring for the CTQ includes: Renaming variables with descriptive names Creating sum scores for each subscale (5 items for each of the 5 subscales) Dichotomizing items for the minimization scale Summing dichotimized items to create the minimization score Key Variables All variables below with appendix _25 reflect the final scoring of weighted subscale sum scores with &lt; 25% missing data. ctq_emo_abuse_25 ctq_phys_abuse_25 ctq_sex_abuse_25 ctq_emo_neglect_25 ctq_phys_neglect_25 ctq_minimize_complete (CTQ minimization score - completers only) 5.2 Demographics Demographics captured in the current study include: Race, Sexual Orientation, Gender, Ethnicity, Student Status, Working Status, Current Living Situation, Assessment Date, and Age Scoring Demographics are primarily drawn from the data collection form (measure prefix ‘dcf’).

(2013) to measure three dimensions of dieting: (1) frequency of past dieting and overeating (i.e. history of dieting), (2) current dieting to lose weight, and (3) weight suppression, or the difference between an individual’s current weight and his or her highest previous weight. Scoring Key Variables 5.4 ED History Questionnaire (EDHQ) The Eating Disorder History Questionnaire was developed by the EMBARK Lab for the current project to assess eating disorder history in the sample. It was used in baseline assessment for the current project prior to September, 2022, at which point the ED100k was substituted as it has been supported through initial validation for this purpose. The Eating Disorder History Questionnaire follows diagnostic algorithmic scoring to assess (via self-report) for history of eating disorder behaviors along with DSM-5 Anorexia Nervosa, Atypical Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder, and Subclinical Eating Pathology. Scoring Key Variables 5.5 ED100k ED100K.V3 questionnaire is a self-report, ED assessment based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, Eating Disorders(Thornton et al., 2018). Items assess DSM-5 criteria for AN, BN, BED, and other specified feeding and eating disorders (OSFED). The ED100K-V1 was found to be a valid measure of eating disorders and eating disorder behaviors. Positive predictive values for AN Criterion B, Criterion C, and binge eating ranged from 88 to 100% in the validation sample. Among women who had a negative screen, the probability of not having these criteria or behaviors ranged from 72 to 100% in the validation sample. The correlation between questionnaire and interview for lowest illness-related BMI was 0.91. Overall, the questionnaire captures historical: eating disorder diagnosis, eating disorder symptoms, eating disorder course of illness, and diagnostic fluctuation within eating disorder diagnosis. Scoring Data cleaning steps include: 1-2. selects variables; recodes the compensatory exercise variable to remove missing codes, and recodes intentional weight control variables to remove missing codes and set ‘0’ equal to a ‘No/Never’ answer 3. overrides skip logic for exercise and other weight control variables such that if individuals have an initial ‘no’ answer where skip logic has overridden future questions, a ‘0’ (reflecting a ‘no/never’ answer) is entered in the subsequent question regarding details of the behavior. 4. Second recode for these questions such that missing codes are change to ‘NA’ and the ‘0’ answers are labelled appropriately 5-7. specifically calculate logic necessary to specify exercise-related outcome variables, described in key variables below. 8. cleans up the dataset by removing erroneous variables that are no longer needed. After these steps ar complete, additional weight suppression variables are calculated and added to the data in the R-script Key variables   Exercise Variables   ED100k_exercise_icb (Was exercise ever used as a behavior to intentionally control weight or shape?)   ED100k_ex_compulsive (Ever felt compelled to exercise for wt and shape control OR uneasy / distressed if unable to exercise)   ED100k_ex_interfere (Did exercise ever interfere in one’s life (changing eating habits, declining opportunities to be with friends, exercising despite illness or injury)   ED100k_ex_excessive (&gt;1 month of psychologically driven exercise every day or nearly every day)   ED100k_ex_addictive (Having psychologically compulsive/driven exercise (feeling compelled to exercise or distressed if unable) that lasted for at least one month AND at least one life interfering symptom)   ED100k_ex_compulsive_1mo (Compulsive/Driven Exercise that lasted for at least one month)   ED100k_ex_maladaptive_1mo (reports driven exercise for at least one month OR any compensatory exercise)   ex_current (Do you currently exercise to control weight and shape AND feel compelled to exercise or distress if unable to exercise?)   Eating Disorder Behavior Variables   Case Status Variables   Weight suppression variables   ED100k_wt_suppress_high_current - current weight suppression   ED100k_wt_suppress_high_lowest - difference between highest weight and lowest weight at adult height   ED100k_wt_suppress_high_AN - difference between highest ever weight at adult height and weight during an AN episode   ED100k_wt_suppress_current_AN - difference between current weight and weight duirng an AN episode   ED100k_bmi_suppress_high_current : current BMI suppression   ED100k_bmi_suppress_high_lowest: high-low BMI suppression   ED100k_bmi_suppress_high_AN : high-AN BMI suppression   ED100k_bmi_suppress_current_AN : current-AN BMI suppression (difference between current BMI and AN BMI) 5.6 Eating Disorder Fear Questionnaire (EDFQ) The EDFQ is a self-report measure of eating disorder specific fears, which was developed and validated in undergraduate college students along with a clinical sample of eating disorder patients by Levinson et al. (2019). A five-factor strucutre for the EDFQ was established, consisting of subscales assessing fear of weight gain, social consequences, personal consequences, physical sensations, and social eating. The EDFQ demonstrates good internal consistency and convergent, divergent, incremental, and construct validity. Scoring Key Variables 5.7 Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory We used the 45-item Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory (EPSI; (Forbush et al., 2013)) to assess eating disorder symptoms at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 8-week follow-up. The EPSI has been validated in clinical, college, and community samples, with 7-8 subscales in various populations, with the 8-subscale version being the most commonly-employed version of the measure (Coniglio et al., 2018). The 8 subscales includ: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (0 = Never; 4= Often) to describe how well each item describes the participant experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across the questions included in each subscale. Scoring Cleaning steps include: 1-2. selecting only the variables that are relevant for the current measure and renaming raw variables to appropraite names that are easy to understand 3. Creating eight additional variables based on sum scores reflecting eight subscales of the questionnaire: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building 4. Creating final variables for use that include calculated average variables for all individuals missing less than 25% of data on a given subscale. For those with missing data, weighted scores are used. Key Variables All variables below reflect the final scoring of weighted subscale sum scores with &lt; 25% missing data. epsi_body_dissatisfaction_25 epsi_binge_25 (binge eating) epsi_restraint_25 epsi_purging_25 epsi_restrict_25 epsi_exercise_25 (excessive exercise) epsi_neg_attitude_25 (negative attidtude towards obesity) epsi_muscle_building_25 5.8 Fat Phobia Scale - Short Form The shortened Fat Phobia Scale (FPS) utilizes 14 questions to assess fatphobia (from the 50-item original scale). It is intended to measure fat phobia levels in the tested population through various personality traits and whether there is bias when people apply them to an overweight person (Bacon et al. (2001)). The shortened FPS questionnaire demonstrates high reliability when compared to the original 50 question scale. The FPS uses a 5-point sliding scale with 1 being equal to a different negative descriptive variable for each respective question and 5 being equal to a different positive variable for each respective question. Some items are reverse scored prior to data aggregation such that th 1 (negative) to 5 (positive) valuation is maintained across the scale. Scoring Data Cleaning includes: 1-2. Selecting and renaming variables to include descriptive terms from questions in the scale. 3. Coding all items such that the negative descriptor is labeled as 1 and the positive descriptor is labeled as 5. 4. Computing a mean score using all 14-items Key Variables fps_mean (Mean score of all 14 items) 5.9 USDA Adult Food Security Survey Module (FSSM) The U.S. Adult Food Security - Survey Module (FSSM) (Carlson et al., 1999) was developed by the USDA Food and Nutrition Services in 1995 for assessing food security within households, specifically for use in the Current Population Survey. The FSSM is primarily designed as a unidimensional, 10-item scale. Previous use in college students indicates that students respond differently to FSSM items relative to the general population, that the FSSM may be a less reliable measure of food insecurity in college students relative to other adults in the US population (Nikolaus et al., 2019), and that there is potential for misclassification of FI college students (Nikolaus et al., 2020), which is a note of caution when interpreting findings from this measure in our young adult sample. however, at present, there is no alternative measure of FI amongst college students with a more robust track-record of validity. Responses of “yes,” “often,” “sometimes,” “almost every month,” and “some months but not every month” are coded as affirmative. The sum of affirmative responses to the 10 questions in the Adult Food Security Scale is then the raw score on the scale. Food security status is assigned as follows: | | - Raw score 0: High food security | - Raw score 1-2: Marginal food security | - Raw score 3-5: Low food security | - Raw score 6-10: Very low food security | |When dichotomizing, the food security status of the first two categories in combination is described as food secure and the latter two as food insecure. Scoring Data cleaning includes: 1-2. Select and rename variables to include numbering of questions in the scale and name of scale being utilized 3. Recode scores in accordance with recommendations (noted above) 4. Create sum scores for dichotomized questions - fssm_total, and average of frequency items fssm_average_freq. 5. Create Food Security Status variable - as outlined above Key Variables fssm_total_25 (sum of 10-item FSSM, those with 25% or less missing - weighted by N completed) fssm_average_freq_complete (average of scores measuring how many days were impacted by previous questions with yes no scores regarding previous 28 days of access and measures taken because of food insecurity - completers) 5.10 Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006) is a seven-item instrument that is used to measure or assess the severity of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her symptoms over the past two weeks. Response options include “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days” and “nearly every day”. The GAD-7 is a widely-used and well-validated measure for anxiety screening (Sapra et al., 2020). the GAD-7 is scored on a unidimensional scale summing all 7 items, with cutoffs that can also be employed for interpretation of clinical severity: | | Minimal anxiety = 0-4 | Mild Anxiety = 5-9 | Moderate Anxiety = 10-14 | Severe Anxiety = 15-21. | | A score of 10 points or higher indicates probably anxiety disorder, with 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity for GAD. Scoresheet Data Cleaning includes: 1-2 Selecting only the variables that are relevant for the current measure and recoding raw variables to make them consistent with the way of scoring: not at all = 0, several days =1, over half the days = 2, nearly every day =3 3-5 creation an additional variable based on sum scores reflecting the participant’s anxiety levels 6 creating a dichotomized measure of likely anxiety (cutoff score of 10 or greater), along with clinical severity index (minimal, mild, moderate, severe) Key variables gad_sum_25 (Sum of GAD-7, 25% or less items missing and weighted by N items completed) gad_cutoffs (GAD-7 with anxiety severity cutoffs employed) gad_anx_disorder (GAD-7 probable anxiety disorder Yes/No) 5.11 Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale The Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale (GFFS) is a 10-item scale which was introduced in 1985 as a diagnostic tool to measure one’s fear of fat as it can be an indicator for the development of an eating disorder (Goldfarb et al., 1985). When used as a screening tool for both clinical and non-clinical groups, GFFS has strong test-retest reliability and psychometric properties (Przybyta-Basista et al., 2022). In addition, the test also has shown high validity for both populations with and without eating disorders (Goldfarb, 2010) While original factor structure is defined as a single-factor, Przybyta-Basista et al. (2022) also supported a two-factor structure in a non-clinical sample: (1) fear of weight gain and (2) fear of losing control over eating/weight. GFFS uses a 4-point scale with 1 being equal to very untrue and 4 being equal to very true Scoring Data Cleaning includes: 1-2. Select and rename variables; recode labels scale to begin at 0 instead of 1 with very untrue being equal to 0 and very true being equal to 3. 3-4. Sum the total scores and create a variable to reflect only those completing &gt; 75% of items. Also create two subscales (FOWG and Fear of LOC) for alternative scoring. |Scoring Note Our GFFS scoring procedure re-scales the item scores to be 0-3 instead of 1-4, meaning that sum scores are scaled 0-21 instead of 7-28. To compare our means to other studies using the GFFS, add 7 to the sum score. Key Variables For variables below, _25 appendix reflects that individuals with &lt;25% missing items on a scale were included with weighted sums based on number of items completed gffs_sum_25 (sum of all items) gffs_fowg_25 (sum of fear of weight gain subscale) gffs_loc_25 (sum of loss of control items) 5.12 Ideal Body Stereotype Scale - Revised (IBSS-R) The Ideal Body Stereotype Scale - Revised (IBSS-R), is a brief (6-item), unidimensional scale designed to measure internalization of an ideal-body stereotype (specifically for women), developed by Stice et al. (1996). The IBSS-R has be utilized as a measure of thin-ideal internalization in eating disorder prevention research (Stice et al., 2019), making it suitable as a benchmark measure for existing effect sizes. Scoring Scoring includes: 1. Selecting and renaming variables. 2. Creating a mean score from all 6 IBSS items Key Variables ibss_mean_25 (Mean of all IBSS items, 25% or less missing) 5.13 Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) js a 20-item, 2 dimensional measure which was introduced in 1988 to measure one’s positive and negative moods (Watson et al., 1988). Compared to other scales measuring positive and negative affect, PANAS has high internal consistency and validity. In addition, the scale also shows consistent reliability, even when measured across gender (Crawford &amp; Henry, 2004). The PANAS asks respondents to indicate how they have felt over the previous week using a 5-point likert scale with 1 = very slightly or not at all and 5 = extremely. The two dimensions include a 10-item positive affect subscale and 10-item negative affect subscale Scoring Data cleaning includes: 1. Selecting and renaming variables 2. Computing subscale sum scores:   - Sum the total scores of questions 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18 as panas_positive_sum   - Sum the total scores of questions 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19 as panas_negative_sum Key Variables Sum scores below reflect weighted sums with 25% or less missing data: panas_positive_sum_25 (sum of scores for questions identifying positive affect over the course of the last week) panas_negative_sum_25 (sum of scores for questions identifying negative affect over the course of the last week) 5.14 Patient Health Questionnnaire -9 (PHQ-9) The 9-question Patient Health Questionnaire is a diagnostic tool introduced in 2001 to screen adult patients in a primary care setting for the presence and severity of depression Kroenke &amp; Spitzer (2002). A PHQ-9 score &gt; or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Scoresheet Cleaning steps include: 1-2. Selecting raw variables being used for the current measure; recode labels scale to begin at 0 instead of 1 with “not at all” = 0, and “nearly every day” = 4 3. Sum the total scores 4. Create severity index and ‘probable depression’ diagnostic cutoff Key Variables phq_sum_25 (represents total score of the PHQ-9; weighted sum 25% or less missing items) phq_dep_severity (severity index of minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression) phq_dep_probable (Probable depression yes/no based on score of 10 or greater) 5.15 Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ) The Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4 (SATAQ) is designed to assess societal and interpersonal aspects of appearance ideals. The SATAQ has five validated factors: Internalization of Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization of Muscular/Athletic, Pressures from Family, Pressures from Media, and Pressures from Peers. This scale structure was confirmed in 3 independent and geographically diverse samples of women from the United States (East Coast N = 440, West Coast N = 304, and North/Midwest N = 349). SATAQ-4 scale scores demonstrated excellent reliability and good convergent validity with measures of body image, eating disturbance, and self-esteem. The measure was also validated in college males from the United States (N = 271); however, there was some evidence of an underlying structure unique to men. For the purposes of the current data, the 5-factor structure is employed in scoring. Scoresheet Cleaning Steps include: 1-3. Selecting raw variables being used and renaming variables to include numbering for order of questions in the scale; recoding labels scale to begin at 0 4. Generate total score and subscale scores:   Internalization of thinness/low Body Fat:   Internalization of muscular/athletic:   Pressures - family:   Pressures - peers:   Pressures - media: Key Variables Variables with the _25 appendix indicate that these variables include those with 25% or less missing data sataq_mean_25 (mean of SATAQ) sataq_thin_ideal_25 (mean of internalization of the thin ideal) sataq_athletic_ideal_25 (mean of internalization of athletic ideal) sataq_parental_pressure_25 (mean of parental pressure) sataq_peer_pressure_25 (mean of peer pressure) sataq_media_pressure_25 (mean of media pressure) 5.16 Traditional Masculinity-Femininity Scale (TMFS) The Traditional Masculinity-Femininity Scale (TMFS) which was introduced in 2016 to assess self-ascribed masculinity and femininity (Kachel et al., 2016). The TMFS has demonstrated high reliability for both sexes. Additionally, TMFS shows validity due to its ability to reduce issues of social desirability when given as a self-assessment. TMFS uses a 7-point likert scale with 1 being equal to totally masculine and 7 being equal to totally feminine. In terms of scoring, the mean is taken of all given answers with an average less than 4 implying masculinity and an average greater than 4 implying femininity. Scoresheet Data cleaning steps include: 1-2 selecting and renaming variables to include numbering of questions in the scale 3-4. Taking the mean total score and rename as tmfs_mean. Create mean variable with 25% or less missing data. Key Variables tmfs_mean_25 (average of scores in response to questions asking about different situations where one could consider their femininity and masculinity. 25% or less missing data) 5.17 Universal Measure of Bias - Fat (UMB-fat) This companion file is for the Universal Measure of Bias - Fat (UMB-Fat) which was introduced in 2008 to assess weight bias and demonstrates strong psychometric properties when utilized as an assessment (Durso &amp; Latner, 2008). It has been compared alongside two other scales measuring universal bias against ‘gay’ or ‘Muslim’ individuals and demonstrates high internal consistency and construct validity (Latner et al., 2008). Further, higher BMI is not associated with any differences in weight bias. The UMB-Fat uses a 7-point likert scale with 1 being equal to strongly agree and 7 being equal to strongly disagree. In terms of scoring, sums of scores are separated amongst four categories of bias: adverse judgement, social distance, attraction, and equal rights. Scoring Data cleaning includes: 1. Selecting and renaming variables to include descriptors of questions asked in the scale 2. Reverse coding questions 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, and 19 so that higher scores indicate greater stigma 3. Creation of subscale scores: Sum the total scores of questions 5, 7, 12 ,15 , 16 = umb_adverse_judgement_sum Sum the total scores of questions 2, 8, 17, 19, 20 = umb_social_distance_sum Sum the total scores of questions 3, 4, 6, 9, 10 = umb_attraction_sum Sum the total scores of questions 1, 11, 13, 14, 18 = umb_equal_rights_sum Sum the total score with sum of all items as umb_sum_total Key Variables All variables below reflect the final scoring of subscale sum scores with &lt; 25% missing data (weighted sums used for those with any missing data). umb_adverse_judgement_sum_25 (adverse judgement against fat people) umb_social_distance_sum_25 (bias in the form of social distance from fat people) umb_attraction_sum_25 (bias in the form of attraction towards fat people) umb_equal_rights_sum_25 (bias in the form of opinons of equal rights for fat people) umb_sum_total_25 (sum of total umb-FAT scores - 25% or less missing) References "],["task-based-measures.html", "Chapter 6 Task-based Measures 6.1 Weight Implicit Association Test (Weight IAT) 6.2 Weight Based Approach Avoidance Task (Weight-AAT)", " Chapter 6 Task-based Measures 6.1 Weight Implicit Association Test (Weight IAT) Weight-IAT task data is housed in its own (long-format) data set within the study database, with keys of subject_id and timepoint. The Weight-IAT is a validated measure of automatic, unconscious attitudes that has previously been used to evaluate implicit weight-related biases (Phelan et al., 2014) The Weight-IAT compares the accuracy of, and time required to categorize images of larger-bodied and thinner people together with positively- and negatively-valanced words. Outcomes include reaction time and percentage of correct categorizations. 6.1.1 Scoring The IAT scoring algorithm involves several steps, with a rigorous scoring procedure involving 12 specifications (Greenwald et al., 2003) Steps include: Using data from Blocks 3,4,6, and 7 Eliminate trials with latencies &gt; 10,000 ms; eliminate subjects for whom more than 10% of trials have latency less than 300 ms Use all remaining trials No extreme-value treatment (beyond Step 2) Compute mean of correct latencies for each block Compute one pooled SD for all trials in blocks 3 &amp; 6; another for blocks 4 &amp; 7 Replace each error latency with block mean (computed in Step 5) + 600 ms No transformation Average the resulting values for each of the four blocks Compute two differences: B6 - B3 and B7 - B4 Divide each difference by its associated pooled- trials SD from Step 6 Average the two quotients from Step 11 R code used for cleaning Weight-IAT data prior to implementing the scoring algorithm is available here - not yet available. R code for completing the scoring algorithm with cleaned data is available here - not yet avaialble 6.1.2 Key Variables 6.2 Weight Based Approach Avoidance Task (Weight-AAT) An interactive task will manipulate congruency between reward- and threat-related outcomes – a task derived from Weaver et al. (2020). Participants learn, through trial-and-error, which of three responses, indicated as geometric shapes, to select to achieve a particular outcome. Critically, each response option is associated with a probability of both a reward outcome (points) and an additional outcome (i.e., images of body parts of those in larger bodies). The response-outcome contingencies (e.g., which option is most likely to lead to reward) switch throughout the task, such that half the time the option that is most likely to lead to reward is also most likely to lead to seeing large body images (Conflict Phase), and half the time the highest reward option is least likely to lead to seeing large body images (Congruent Phase) . Participants are instructed to earn as many points as possible (reward goals), allowing us to test biases in decision-making when large body images are likely. In each trial, participants would choose a shape, and, after a delay (.5-.75s), the point outcome for that trial appeared under the image (presented for 1.5–2.5s) while the image remained on screen, indicating a positive or negative value (e.g., +5 or -7). Trials were separated by a fixation cross, presented for .5-1.5s. The type of image (trauma-related or neutral) and the direction of points (positive, negative) were experimentally manipulated to reflect probabilities that aligned with the type of phase. The number of points won/lost was randomly generated (range: 1-10). Task Phases were not counterbalanced in order to allow for initial task structure learning before the introduction to the Conflict Phase. On all trials, both outcomes (image type, point win/loss) had either an 80%, 50%, or 20% chance of occurring. The image type and point win/loss probabilities were independent from one another. Probabilities for each outcome for the left and right shape (circle and hexagon) were adjusted throughout the task to create the Conflict and Congruent Phases. 6.2.1 Scoring 6.2.1.1 Difference Score We can also create a crude individual difference score to represent discrepancy between the two task phases (Mean Conflict Phase points - Mean Congruent Phase Points), with higher difference score reflecting a higher degree of conflict between the two phases. 6.2.1.2 Linear Mixed Effects Model Code for scoring the Weight-AAT using a Linear mixed Effects Model Approach is available here - not yet available Weight-AAT task data is housed in its own (long-format) data set within the study database, with keys of subject_id and timepoint. The Linear Mixed Effects Model uses trial-wise outcomes (i.e. modeling outcomes on all trials for each participant). Prior to analysis, predictors and outcomes are scaled for analysis including block, Phase (Conflict = -1, Congruent - 1), and Trial (z-scored within each block) and regressed on Total Points (scaled from 0 to 1). Trial is coded to account for learning within block (e.g. trial number 1-25 z-scored to represent linear learning throughout a trial). Ultimate outputs of this model would include a random intercept and random slope for Phase, Block, Trial, and their interactions to account for individual variability – e.g: Points ~ Phase + Trial + Block + Phase * Trial + Phase * Block + Trial * Block + Phase * Trial * Block + Age + Gender + (1+Phase * Trial * Block|sub) To examine BMI differences, a Phase * BMI and Phase * Trial * BMI interaction may also be introduced to the model 6.2.1.3 Drift Diffusion Modeling xxx 6.2.2 Key Variables aat_difference_score : Difference between points obtained during the conflict phases vs. congruent phases of the task aat_phase : Trial Phase (Conflict = -1, Congruent = 1) References "],["sample-description.html", "Chapter 7 Sample Description", " Chapter 7 Sample Description In 2021, we ran a pilot version of this program (N = 29) randomizing young adults to either a 2-session Body Project or Body Advocacy Movement (BAM; described below) intervention (see Figure 1 for Pilot enrollment). Average fear of fatness in the full sample at baseline was similar to samples of ‘repeat dieters’ (Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale average at Baseline = 23.26), but lower than clinical samples of those with active EDs. A subsample in the second wave of recruitment completed a measure of ED history, with questions specifically assessing ED diagnostic criteria. Among this subsample of participants, 60% reported history of symptoms consistent with a full-threshold ED diagnosis (AN = 33%, BN = 20%, BED = 7%) and an additional 20% reported a history of subthreshold symptoms (Driven exercise to lose weight = 13%, Subclinical BED = 7%).
