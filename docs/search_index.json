While existing, dissonance programs (i.e. the Body Project) target reductions in thin-ideal internalization, fears related to fatness and weight gain may be a particularly salient cognitive target among those with current or past eating disorder symptomatology (Levinson et al. (2014)). Past studies have demonstrated the high school population (youth ages 14-18) to be especially susceptible to the development of eating disorders like anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) (Kohn &amp; Golden (2001)). In an effort to mitigate risk for ED onset and minimize the development of EDs among late adolescents, the current project includes development and initial evaluation of a novel intervention that focuses specifically on fear of fatness and anti-fat bias (the Body Advocacy Movement in High Schools; BAM High). This project aims to recruit 30 high school students (ages 14-18) to all participate in the BAM High intervention. Our objective is to examine the degree to which BAM can reduce fear of fatness and weight gain along with internalized anti-fat bias and reduce risk and development ED symptoms in a late adolescent sample. We will evaluate feasibility and acceptability of BAM High and estimate effects of the intervention on self-report and behavioral measures of fear of weight gain and fatness, anti-fat bias, and eating disorder symptoms. 1.1 Specific Aims Aim 1: Examine the acceptability and feasibility of BAM in a high-risk young adult sample. Acceptability: Acceptability will be assessed via attrition across a 4-session intervention along with qualitative feedback from a brief survey at post-intervention. We expect to meet benchmarks of high acceptability (average ratings of &gt; 4 [out of 5] on post-intervention survey; &lt; 20% attrition). Feasibility: Feasibility will be benchmarked via intervention adherence (average competency &gt; 8.0 on 0-10 scale) and recruitment goals. Aim 2: Estimate the effects of the intervention on fear of fatness, anti-fat bias, and eating disorder symptoms. We hypothesize that the BAM intervention will result in acute reductions (post-intervention) in fatphobia and anti-fat bias across self—report and behavioral measures, outperforming the Body Project on targets related to anti-fat bias, specifically.

Participants will complete four facilitator-lead, 1-hour sessions, and complete a series of assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and at the conclusion of the final session and 1-month follow-up. 2.1 Recruitment Recruitment sources include: (1) School administrators and teachers (2) flyering at area businesses (e.g. fitness centers, coffee shops) and through high school emailing services (3) online advertisement on social media platforms (4) Outreach to community-based organizations (5) Outreach to ED providers in the community "],["intervention.html", "Chapter 3 Intervention 3.1 The Body Advocacy Movement 3.2 Session 4 3.3 Peer Facilitators 3.4 Intervention Fidelity", " Chapter 3 Intervention 3.1 The Body Advocacy Movement BAM leverages both dissonance and exposure-based intervention strategies, adapting common exercises used to promote body acceptance and challenge sociocultural body ideals to specifically target anti-fat bias and internalized fatphobia. Participants in BAM will (1) Define anti-fat bias and fatphobia and explore how these constructs manifest in personal beliefs and interpersonal interactions, (2) Engage in imaginal exposure exercises to challenge fears related to fatness and weight gain (3) Reflect on how fears of fatness align with personal values, (4) Learn new ways to challenge fear of fatness and internalized anti-fat bias and (5) Discuss ways to challenge anti-fat bias on an institutional and societal level. Intervention content. 3.1.1 Session 1 Session 1 includes introductions, discussing identities and clarifying terminology, and an exercise in defining anti-fat bias and fatphobia. 3.1.2 Session 2 Within Session 2 participants will be asked to complete an imaginal exposure exercise several times during the week in which they will write and then recount a ‘worst-case scenario’ of what they might fear could happen if they gained a significant amount of weight. ##Session 3 Session 3 includes debriefing the exposure homework and identification of ways one might uproot internalized fear of fatness, along with a series of role plays in which peer facilitators will play the role of a friend or family member in a situation that evokes anti-fat attitudes, and participants will practice challenging these attitudes. 3.2 Session 4 Within session 4, participants will also identify ways to challenge anti-fat bias in society and commit to engaging in one activity to do so in the coming week. As an exit exercise, they will write a ‘response letter’ to their worst-case scenario. 3.3 Peer Facilitators The facilitators are all, at a minimum, graduate-level mental health providers. Each facilitator will participate in an 8-hour training program, similar to (sticeClinicianLedPeerLedInternetDelivered2017?). Facilitators will role-play delivery of the entire intervention and observe other facilitators in doing the same. Facilitators will be supervised by Dr. Schaumberg. 3.4 Intervention Fidelity Sessions will be audio recorded and reviewed by two members of research staff. Audio recorded sessions will be rated for fidelity and competence. Research staff will independently code a randomly selected sample of 50% of sessions for implementation fidelity and facilitator competence using checklists assessing the major exercises and discussion topics for each session. Each component will be rated for degree of accurate presentation (10-point scale from “No adherence; the section was skipped” to “Perfect; all material in the section was presented as written”). Facilitator competence will be rated using 12 items assessing indicators of competence (e.g., leaders express ideas clearly and at an appropriate pace, leaders attempt to allot equal speaking time for all members) on a 10-point scale.

The survey begins by addressing weight suppression, lowest adult weight, and dieting history. The survey then addresses eating disorder behaviors and cognitions in both a past and present sense. The final questions of the ED100k Plus address menstrual information for female participants. Scoring Data cleaning steps include: 1-2. selects variables; recodes the compensatory exercise variable to remove missing codes, and recodes intentional weight control variables to remove missing codes and set ‘0’ equal to a ‘No/Never’ answer 3. overrides skip logic for exercise and other weight control variables such that if individuals have an initial ‘no’ answer where skip logic has overridden future questions, a ‘0’ (reflecting a ‘no/never’ answer) is entered in the subsequent question regarding details of the behavior. 4. Second recode for these questions such that missing codes are change to ‘NA’ and the ‘0’ answers are labelled appropriately 5-7. specifically calculate logic necessary to specify exercise-related outcome variables, described in key variables below. 8. cleans up the dataset by removing erroneous variables that are no longer needed.

The EPSI has been validated in clinical, college, and community samples, with 7-8 subscales in various populations, with the 8-subscale version being the most commonly-employed version of the measure (coniglioFactorialIntegrityValidation2018?). The 8 subscales include: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building. Scoring Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (0 = Never; 4= Often) to describe how well each item describes the participant experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across the questions included in each subscale. The eight subscales of the measure are: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building. Key Variables All variables below reflect the final scoring of weighted subscale sum scores with &lt; 25% missing data. epsi_body_dissatisfaction_25 epsi_binge_25 (binge eating) epsi_restraint_25 epsi_purging_25 epsi_restrict_25 epsi_exercise_25 (excessive exercise) epsi_neg_attitude_25 (negative attidtude towards obesity) epsi_muscle_building_25 5.4 Fat Phobia Scale - Short Form The shortened Fat Phobia Scale (FPS) utilizes 14 questions to assess fatphobia (from the 50-item original scale). It is intended to measure fat phobia levels in the tested population through various personality traits and whether there is bias when people apply them to an overweight person (Bacon et al., 2001). The shortened FPS questionnaire demonstrates high reliability when compared to the original 50 question scale. Scoring The FPS uses a 5-point sliding scale with 1 being equal to a different negative descriptive variable for each respective question and 5 being equal to a different positive variable for each respective question. Some items are reverse scored prior to data aggregation such that th 1 (negative) to 5 (positive) valuation is maintained across the scale. A mean score is created from the 14 items. Key Variables fps_mean (Mean score of all 14 items) 5.5 Child Food Security Survey Module (CFSSM) The U.S. Adult Food Security - Survey Module (US FSSM) (carlsonMeasuringFoodInsecurity1999?) was developed by the USDA Food and Nutrition Services in 1995 for assessing food security within households, specifically for use in the Current Population Survey. The US FSSM was adapted for administration with children, creating the Child FSSM (CFSSM), which is a 9-item survey that demonstrates sufficient reliability in measuring food insecurity (Connell et al., 2004). Scoring Respondents had to answer the 9 items with either “A lot”, “Sometimes”, or “Never”. Responses “A lot” and “Sometimes” were dichotomous as affirmative while “Never” remained negative. The sum of affirmative responses to the 9 questions is then the raw score on the scale. Food security status is assigned as follows: | | - Raw score 0-1: Food secure | - Raw score 2-5: Food insecure without hunger | - Raw score 6+: Food insecure with hunger | | Key Variables 5.6 Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) (spitzerBriefMeasureAssessing2006?) is a seven-item instrument that is used to measure or assess the severity of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her symptoms over the past two weeks. Response options include “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days” and “nearly every day”. The GAD-7 is a widely-used and well-validated measure for anxiety screening (sapraUsingGeneralizedAnxiety2020?). the GAD-7 is scored on a unidimensional scale summing all 7 items, with cutoffs that can also be employed for interpretation of clinical severity: | | Minimal anxiety = 0-4 | Mild Anxiety = 5-9 | Moderate Anxiety = 10-14 | Severe Anxiety = 15-21. | | Scoring The sum of the respondent’s answers is used to generate an idea of the respondent’s anxiety level. A score of 10 points or higher indicates probably anxiety disorder, with 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity for GAD. We have also created a dichotomized measure of likely anxiety (cutoff score of 10 or greater), along with clinical severity index (minimal, mild, moderate, severe). Key variables gad_sum_25 (Sum of GAD-7, 25% or less items missing and weighted by N items completed) gad_cutoffs (GAD-7 with anxiety severity cutoffs employed) gad_anx_disorder (GAD-7 probable anxiety disorder Yes/No) 5.7 Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale The Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale (GFFS) is a 10-item scale which was introduced in 1985 as a diagnostic tool to measure one’s fear of fat as it can be an indicator for the development of an eating disorder (goldfarbGoldfarbFearFat1985?). When used as a screening tool for both clinical and non-clinical groups, GFFS has strong test-retest reliability and psychometric properties (przybyta-basistaExaminationFactorStructure2022?). In addition, the test also has shown high validity for both populations with and without eating disorders (Goldfarb, 2010) While original factor structure is defined as a single-factor, (przybyta-basistaExaminationFactorStructure2022?) also supported a two-factor structure in a non-clinical sample: (1) fear of weight gain and (2) fear of losing control over eating/weight. Scoring GFFS uses a 4-point scale with 1 being equal to very untrue and 4 being equal to very true. The GFFS is scored by summing the items to create a total score. The measure also contains two subscales (fear of weight gain (FOWG) and loss of control (LOC) which can also be summed. Key Variables For variables below, _25 appendix reflects that individuals with &lt;25% missing items on a scale were included with weighted sums based on number of items completed gffs_sum_25 (sum of all items) gffs_fowg_25 (sum of fear of weight gain subscale) gffs_loc_25 (sum of loss of control items) 5.8 Mini Menstrual Questionnaire (MMQ) The Mini Menstrual Questionnaire, or MMQ, is a tool that the EMBARK Lab created to assess menstruating individuals’ menstrual history and current menstrual status. This measure assesses the regularity of the individual’s menstrual cycles, the form of birth control (if any) the individual uses, if they are pregnant or breastfeeding, and past gynecological procedures they have undergone (if any). 5.9 Scale of Subjective Social Status (SSSS) The MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status - Youth Version measures perceived social status among adolescents between 7th and 12th grade (Goodman et al., 2001). The measure includes two ladders: one to assess perceived family status in US American Society and the other to assess perceived personal status within one’s school community. Scoring Each of the two ladders has 10 rungs that the participants can place themselves on. The top rung represents the people who are “best off” in US American society (described as having the most money, highest amount of schooling, and jobs that bring the most respect) in the first ladder and the people in school with the highest status (described as highest grades, standing, and most respect) in the second ladder. Higher scores (with a 10 being the highest) represent higher perceived social status in each setting. Key Variables 5.10 Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) The Beck Depression Inventory (or BDI) is a 21-item, self-report survey that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression (Beck et al., 1961). Participants are asked to rank each question, which reflects a symptom or attitude related to depression, on a scale from 0 to 3, with zero reflecting the absence of the symptom or attitude and 3 reflecting the most severe experience of the symptom or attitude. For example, one question asks about feelings of being a failure and the options range from “I do not feel like a failure.” to “I feel like I am a complete failure as a person.” Scoring Scoring is completed by summing the totals of each of the 21 items. A higher score represents higher symptomatology of depression (Beck et al., 1988). Although Beck and colleagues urge clinicians to use their clinical judgement in assigning cut-off scores, typically a score of 10 or lower represents none or minimal depression, 10-18 indicates moderate depression, 19-29 indicates moderate to severe depression, and scores 30 or above indicates severe depression (Beck et al., 1988). Key Variables 5.11 Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ) The Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4 (SATAQ) is designed to assess societal and interpersonal aspects of appearance ideals. The SATAQ has five validated factors: Internalization of Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization of Muscular/Athletic, Pressures from Family, Pressures from Media, and Pressures from Peers. This scale structure was confirmed in 3 independent and geographically diverse samples of women from the United States (East Coast N = 440, West Coast N = 304, and North/Midwest N = 349). SATAQ-4 scale scores demonstrated excellent reliability and good convergent validity with measures of body image, eating disturbance, and self-esteem. The measure was also validated in college males from the United States (N = 271); however, there was some evidence of an underlying structure unique to men. For the purposes of the current data, the 5-factor structure is employed in scoring. Scoring For the SATAQ, a total score is generated based on the mean of the respondent’s answers. Additionally, subscale scores (internalization of thinness/low body fat, internalization of muscular/athletic. pressures - family, pressures - peers, and pressures - media) are also calculated. Key Variables Variables with the _25 appendix indicate that these variables include those with 25% or less missing data sataq_mean_25 (mean of SATAQ) sataq_thin_ideal_25 (mean of internalization of the thin ideal) sataq_athletic_ideal_25 (mean of internalization of athletic ideal) sataq_parental_pressure_25 (mean of parental pressure) sataq_peer_pressure_25 (mean of peer pressure) sataq_media_pressure_25 (mean of media pressure) 5.12 Traditional Masculinity-Femininity Scale (TMFS) The Traditional Masculinity-Femininity Scale (TMFS) which was introduced in 2016 to assess self-ascribed masculinity and femininity (Kachel et al., 2016). The TMFS has demonstrated high reliability for both sexes. Additionally, TMFS shows validity due to its ability to reduce issues of social desirability when given as a self-assessment. TMFS uses a 7-point likert scale with 1 being equal to totally masculine and 7 being equal to totally feminine. In terms of scoring, the mean is taken of all given answers with an average less than 4 implying masculinity and an average greater than 4 implying femininity. Scoring The mean is taken of all given answers with an average less than 4 implying masculinity and an average greater than 4 implying femininity. Key Variables tmfs_mean_25 (average of scores in response to questions asking about different situations where one could consider their femininity and masculinity. 25% or less missing data) 5.13 Fat Stereotypes Questionnaire (FSQ) Davison and Birch (Davison &amp; Birch, 2004) developed the Fat Stereotype Questionnaire (FSQ) to assess fat stereotypes among 9 year old girls. This scale asks participants to think about attributes such as happiness, intelligence, attractiveness, laziness, having a lot of friends, and goodness/badness in relation to fatness and thinness. Scoring Participants respond to prompts that are descriptors of both “thin” and “fat” people as the subject. They respond using a four-point Likert scale, which ranges from “really disagree” to “really agree,” which produces 18 scores (9 of which are with “fat” subjects and 9 of which are with “thin” subjects). Scoring is completed by calculating discrepancy scores (fat people attribute - thin people attribute) and calculating the mean of the 9 discrepancy scores. Scores above 0 indicate that the participant more strongly endorses that attribute for thin people, whereas scores below 0 indicate that the participant more strongly endorses that attribute for fat people. Importantly, before calculating the mean score, the attributes need to be reverse coded in order to interpret all values in the same direction. The internal consistency for this measure in Davison and Birch’s (2014) sample was ɑ = 0.71. Key Variables 5.14 Perception of Teasing Scale (POTS) The Perception of Teasing Scale (also known as POTS) was developed by Thompson et al.(Thompson et al., 1995) to assess children and adolescents’ history of being teased in relationship to a high-weight status and social competency. López-Guimerà et al. (López-Guimerà et al., 2012) validated an 11-item version of POTS with Spanish adolescents. The measure contains two subscales: weight-related teasing and competency-related teasing. Both subscales have a satisfactory level of internal consistency. A response-to-teasing is also assessed by asking the participant if they experienced any emotional distress due to the teasing they experienced. Scoring The teasing scale ranges from “never” to “always,” with “always” occupying the number five. The upset scale is also on a 5-point Likert scale from “not upset” to “very upset”. The final teasing score is generated by generating a sum of the score for all of the teasing items. A separate score for emotional distress is calculated by creating a sum for all of the repsonse-to-teasing items. Key Variables 5.15 Feedback Survey The feedback survey is a lab-created 15-question survey that asks questions about the participants’ experiences participating in BAM High. This survey asks participants to reflect on their experiences participating and evaluate the program in terms of facilitator strength, helpfulness, level of distress related to the intervention, and more. There are some items that ask for a “yes” or “no” answer, while others provide space for open comment.

The Weight-IAT is a validated measure of automatic, unconscious attitudes that has previously been used to evaluate implicit weight-related biases (phelanImplicitExplicitWeight2014?) The Weight-IAT compares the accuracy of, and time required to categorize images of larger-bodied and thinner people together with positively- and negatively-valanced words. Outcomes include reaction time and percentage of correct categorizations. 6.1.1 Scoring The IAT scoring algorithm involves several steps, with a rigorous scoring procedure involving 12 specifications (greenwaldUnderstandingUsingImplicit2003?)

Participants learn, through trial-and-error, which of three responses, indicated as geometric shapes, to select to achieve a particular outcome. Critically, each response option is associated with a probability of both a reward outcome (points) and an additional outcome (i.e., images of body parts of those in larger bodies). The response-outcome contingencies (e.g., which option is most likely to lead to reward) switch throughout the task, such that half the time the option that is most likely to lead to reward is also most likely to lead to seeing large body images (Conflict Phase), and half the time the highest reward option is least likely to lead to seeing large body images (Congruent Phase) . Participants are instructed to earn as many points as possible (reward goals), allowing us to test biases in decision-making when large body images are likely. In each trial, participants would choose a shape, and, after a delay (.5-.75s), the point outcome for that trial appeared under the image (presented for 1.5–2.5s) while the image remained on screen, indicating a positive or negative value (e.g., +5 or -7). Trials were separated by a fixation cross, presented for .5-1.5s. The type of image (trauma-related or neutral) and the direction of points (positive, negative) were experimentally manipulated to reflect probabilities that aligned with the type of phase. The number of points won/lost was randomly generated (range: 1-10). Task Phases were not counterbalanced in order to allow for initial task structure learning before the introduction to the Conflict Phase. On all trials, both outcomes (image type, point win/loss) had either an 80%, 50%, or 20% chance of occurring. The image type and point win/loss probabilities were independent from one another. Probabilities for each outcome for the left and right shape (circle and hexagon) were adjusted throughout the task to create the Conflict and Congruent Phases. 6.2.1 Scoring 6.2.1.1 Difference Score We can also create a crude individual difference score to represent discrepancy between the two task phases (Mean Conflict Phase points - Mean Congruent Phase Points), with higher difference score reflecting a higher degree of conflict between the two phases. 6.2.1.2 Linear Mixed Effects Model Code for scoring the Weight-AAT using a Linear mixed Effects Model Approach is available here - not yet available Weight-AAT task data is housed in its own (long-format) data set within the study database, with keys of subject_id and timepoint. The Linear Mixed Effects Model uses trial-wise outcomes (i.e. modeling outcomes on all trials for each participant). Prior to analysis, predictors and outcomes are scaled for analysis including block, Phase (Conflict = -1, Congruent - 1), and Trial (z-scored within each block) and regressed on Total Points (scaled from 0 to 1). Trial is coded to account for learning within block (e.g. trial number 1-25 z-scored to represent linear learning throughout a trial). Ultimate outputs of this model would include a random intercept and random slope for Phase, Block, Trial, and their interactions to account for individual variability – e.g: Points ~ Phase + Trial + Block + Phase * Trial + Phase * Block + Trial * Block + Phase * Trial * Block + Age + Gender + (1+Phase * Trial * Block|sub) To examine BMI differences, a Phase * BMI and Phase * Trial * BMI interaction may also be introduced to the model 6.2.1.3 Drift Diffusion Modeling xxx 6.2.2 Key Variables aat_difference_score : Difference between points obtained during the conflict phases vs. congruent phases of the task aat_phase : Trial Phase (Conflict = -1, Congruent = 1) "],["sample-description.html", "Chapter 7 Sample Description", " Chapter 7 Sample Description For this study, we are recruiting a sample of 14-18 year olds who are currently enrolled in high school.

We are also posting flyers physically at local businesses, as well as online through a website called PeachJar (a platform that many local school districts use to distribute flyers) and on social media. [ONCE WE HAVE A SAMPLE WE CAN INCLUDE CORRECT FIGURES HERE] "],["data-requests-and-terms-of-use.html", "Chapter 8 Data Requests and Terms of Use", " Chapter 8 Data Requests and Terms of Use We aim to share data from the BAM project will all interested parties. Depending on data necessary for analysis, this may include providing collaborative access to the data via external log-in to our research drive and completing a data transfer and use agreement. We expect most data requests will take 2-4 weeks for administrative processing. In order to request data use, please complete the following steps: 1. Send an email with the title ‘BAM data use’ to embarklab@psychaitry.wisc.edu with the following information: a. Name, affiliation, training status and year (e.g. second-year graduate student; post-baccalaureate research coordinator, first-year postdoc, assistant professor) b. Tentative title for proposed analysis and 1-paragraph description c. Two identified EMBARK Lab collaborators you would be interested in working with (see lab personnel for information about lab members and their interests) 2. Book a 15-minute meeting with Dr. Schaumberg to discuss your idea. For secondary analysis projects that exclusively use BAM data, Dr. Schaumberg will serve as senior (last) author, and at least one additional EMBARK Lab collaborator will join as an author on the project. Alternative arrangements can be discussed if BAM is one of multiple data sources for a project. "],["analytic-plan.html", "Chapter 9 Analytic Plan", " Chapter 9 Analytic Plan Aim 1: Confirm the feasibility and acceptability of a fatphobia and weight stigma intervention. We will confirm the feasibility and acceptability of our intervention structure and content via (a) study attrition at all timepoints, (b) participant attendance to the 4 sessions, (c) completion rates of study activities both prior to and following sessions, and (d) intervention adherence and facilitator competence. To assess intervention adherence and facilitator competence, sessions will be audio recorded and reviewed by two members of research staff using a 12-item leader competence assessment. Over the course of the study, we expect study attrition to be &lt;20%, attendance at all 4 sessions to be &gt;80%, and completion rates of study activities to be &gt;75%. Feasibility will be benchmarked via two primary outcomes: (a) we expect high levels of intervention adherence in the intervention, with high interrater reliability and average treatment fidelity and facilitator competence ratings at or above 8.0 on a 10-point scale, and (b) we expect to meet recruitment goals (N = 30). Aim 2: Estimating intervention effects. Reductions in anti-fat bias will be assessed via changes in self-report fatphobia and anti-fat bias as well as shifts in IAT and AAT task performance from baseline to post-intervention and baseline to 4-week follow-up. To evaluate changes over time for the singular group, we would use a paired t-test to assess if the intervention changed participants’ cognitions about fatphobia and weight stigma. Aim 3: Eating Disorder Prevention. Reductions in eating disorder symptomology will be assessed via changes in self-report eating disorder behaviors and cognitions from baseline to post-intervention and baseline to 4-week follow-up. We will specifically assess how the intervention has affected participants that have been identified as demonstrating disordered eating (ED) at baseline. To evaluate changes over time between the ED and healthy group, we will use mixed effects modeling, estimating fixed effects of Condition, Time, and a Time x Condition interaction, with a random intercept of participant to account for baseline differences.
