  abstract = {By characterizing the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to build a resource to help to understand the genetic contribution to disease. Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38\,million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4\,million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98\% of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1\% in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.}

  abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) is often associated with physical hyperactivity. Recent studies have established links between anorexia and hyperactivity, suggesting the existence of commonalities in neural pathways. How physical activity should be managed during the clinical care of patients with anorexia remains controversial. This review first focuses on the implication of hyperactivity in the pathophysiology of AN. Hyperactivity during refeeding of patients with AN has been associated with increased energy needs to achieve weight gain, poorer clinical outcome, longer hospitalization, and increased psychiatric comorbidity. This typically leads to the prescription of bed rest. However, current knowledge suggests that preserving some kind of physical activity during refeeding of patients with AN should be safe and beneficial for the restoration of body composition, the preservation of bone mineral density, and the management of mood and anxiety. In the absence of standardized guidelines, it is suggested here that physical activity during refeeding of patients with AN should be personalized according to the physical and mental status of each patient. More research is needed to assess whether programmed physical activity may be a beneficial part of the treatment of AN.}

The current study evaluated the hypothesis that psychological commitment to exercise (compulsive quality) will be more predictive of disordered eating attitudes and behaviors than the amount of time devoted to exercise (excessive quantity). METHOD:  Female (n = 162) and male (n = 103) undergraduates completed the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) subscales, the Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire (OEQ), and questions to assess the duration and frequency of exercise. RESULTS:  Using multivariate analysis, the OEQ score was a positive predictor of disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, and exercise time was a negative predictor. DISCUSSION:  "Compulsive" may be a better description than "excessive" in characterizing exercise as a symptom of bulimia nervosa.},

An adapted version of the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire was used to assess eating disorder symptoms at ages 14, 17 and 20 years. The Beck Depression Inventory for Youth was used to assess depressive symptoms at age 14.

A new sample of 255 people completed the original 50-item scale. The reliability of a shortened 14-item version of the scale was tested and compared to that of the full scale using both the new sample and the original sample of 1135 study participants. RESULTS: The fat phobia scale \DH{} short form demonstrated excellent reliability in both samples and was strongly correlated with the 50-item scale. Mean and 90th percentile scores are given for both the long and short versions of the scale. CONCLUSION: The shortened fat phobia scale is expected to increase the utility of the measure in a diverse array of research and clinical settings. Future research should focus on developing scale norms for the general population and conducting research on fat phobia in males and among different ethnic groups.},

The STAI-T, the Beck Depression Inventory\textendash II, the Teate Depression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were administered to 1124 psychiatric outpatients and to 877 healthy subjects. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed in order to compare various models in the literature. The internal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity of the STAI-T as well as its factorial subscales were assessed. The one-construct two-method (i.e., the STAI-T measures one substantive anxiety construct plus artifacts due to negative\textendash positive item polarity) and the bifactor (i.e., the STAI-T comprises two first-order specific factors [``Anxiety'' and ``Depression''] and one first-order general factor) models were the best-fitting solutions for the STAI\textendash T in both the clinical and nonclinical samples. The STAI\textendash T total score correlated more strongly with measures of depression than with a concurrent measure of anxiety. The STAI-T should be considered a measure of general negative affect, including specific aspects of cognitive anxiety and depression together.},

Results: Fifteen studies were identified that examined the psychometrics of the EDE, whereas 10 studies were found that examined the psychometrics of the EDE-Q. Discussion: Both instruments demonstrated reliability of scores. There is evidence that scores on the EDE and EDE-Q correlate with scores on measures of similar constructs and support for using the instruments to distinguish between cases and non-cases.

METHOD: Three hundred ninety-eight male and female adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) admitted to the inpatient service of a private psychiatric hospital were given the CTQ as part of a larger test battery. Structured interviews were also conducted with the primary therapists of 190 of the patients to obtain ratings of abuse and neglect based on all available data, including clinical interviews with patients and their relatives and information from referring clinicians and agencies. RESULTS: Principal-components analysis of the CTQ items yielded five rotated factors-emotional abuse, emotional neglect, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and physical neglect-closely replicating the factor structure in an earlier study of adult patients. The internal consistency of the CTQ factors was extremely high both in the entire sample and in every subgroup examined. When CTQ factor scores were compared with therapists' ratings in a series of logistic regression analyses, relationships between the two sets of variables were highly specific, supporting the convergent and discriminant validity of the CTQ. Finally, when therapists' ratings were used as the validity criterion, the CTQ exhibited good sensitivity for all forms of maltreatment, and satisfactory or better levels of specificity. CONCLUSIONS: These initial findings suggest that the CTQ is a sensitive and valid screening questionnaire for childhood trauma in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient setting.},

Objective The study assessed the influence of body dissatisfaction on smoking, cannabis use, drug use, self-harm, gambling, and drinking and the mediating role of disordered eating in a population-based sample of British adolescents. Method Participants were 2634 females and 1684 males from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Logistic regression was used to test if body dissatisfaction at 14 years old predicted the onset of risky health behaviours at 21 years old. Mediation analysis tested the mediating role of disordered eating at 16 years old on each risky health behaviour. Results Among females, body dissatisfaction predicted smoking (OR\,=\,1.40, 95\% CI\,=\,1.15, 1.72), cannabis use (OR\,=\,1.20, 95\% CI\,=\,1.00, 1.43), drug use (OR\,=\,1.51, 95\% CI\,=\,1.20, 1.90), self-harm (OR\,=\,1.44, 95\% CI\,=\,1.13, 1.84) and high-risk drinking (OR\,=\,1.41, 95\% CI\,=\,1.10, 1.80). Disordered eating symptoms had mediating effects on some behaviours. Among males, body dissatisfaction predicted smoking (OR\,=\,1.44, 95\% CI\,=\,1.14, 1.81) and no effect of disordered eating was found on any risky health behaviour. Conclusions This is the first prospective study to demonstrate that body dissatisfaction in adolescence predicts the occurrence of several risky health behaviours, and elucidates the mediating role of disordered eating. The findings highlight that body dissatisfaction is a public health concern. Early interventions to promote body satisfaction may reduce the prevalence of later risky health behaviours.},

It considers multiple genetic, epigenetic, biological, psychological, social and other environmental exposures in relation to a similarly diverse range of health, social and developmental outcomes. Recruitment sought to enroll pregnant women in the Bristol area of the UK during 1990-92; this was extended to include additional children eligible using the original enrollment definition up to the age of 18 years. The children from 14541 pregnancies were recruited in 1990-92, increasing to 15247 pregnancies by the age of 18 years. This cohort profile describes the index children of these pregnancies. Follow-up includes 59 questionnaires (4 weeks-18 years of age) and 9 clinical assessment visits (7-17 years of age). The resource comprises a wide range of phenotypic and environmental measures in addition to biological samples, genetic (DNA on 11343 children, genome-wide data on 8365 children, complete genome sequencing on 2000 children) and epigenetic (methylation sampling on 1000 children) information and linkage to health and administrative records. Data access is described in this article and is currently set up as a supported access resource. To date, over 700 peer-reviewed articles have been published using ALSPAC data.}

The usefulness of the PDS, Tanner ratings, and self-reported height and weight as adequate estimates of pubertal development is discussed.}

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

The exercise participants were women who were medically cleared and attended at least two exercise groups during treatment. The control group were women who were medically cleared, but did not attend any exercise groups during treatment. Significant group x diagnosis interactions revealed that women in the exercise group who were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa gained more than one-third as much weight as those in the control group. Also, women in the exercise group demonstrated significantly reduced obligatory attitudes toward exercise compared to the control group. These findings suggest that the use of an exercise program that targets exercise abuse in women with eating disorders is feasible during residential treatment and results in positive change without interfering with weight gain. Limitations that result from the lack of random assignment to the exercise and control group are discussed.},

Sexual orientation was assessed at 16~years. Eating disorder symptoms were assessed at 14 and 16~years. Multivariable regression models (adjusting for BMI, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) examined associations between sexual orientation and (1) odds of past-year purging and binge eating, and (2) mean differences in body dissatisfaction, pressure to increase muscularity (boys only), and Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire subscales. At age 14, gay and bisexual boys and mostly heterosexual girls reported greater body dissatisfaction than their same-gender heterosexual peers. All sexual minority boys and mostly heterosexual girls reported greater mean dysfunctional eating behaviors than their same-gender heterosexual peers. At age 16, gay and bisexual boys had 12.5 times the odds of heterosexual boys of binge eating; mostly heterosexual boys had over three times the odds of reporting binge eating. Sexual minority girls had over twice the odds of heterosexual girls of purging and binge eating. By mid-adolescence, sexual minority youth in the UK had elevated risk for eating disorder symptoms, suggesting the need for early prevention efforts.}

It is a key component of worry, state anxiety, and related anxiety pathologies. The 27-item Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) was developed to measure intolerance of uncertainty. Previous psychometric analyses of the IUS have suggested both four- and five-factor models. High inter-item correlations, factor instability, and previous theoretical research support the development of a reduced measure. The present study used two undergraduate samples and evaluated a psychometrically stable 12-item two-factor version of the IUS. The reduced measure (IUS-12) retained exemplary internal consistency, while correlating extremely well with the original IUS and related measures of anxiety and worry. The IUS-12 also demonstrated a stable two-factor structure, representing both anxious and avoidance components of intolerance of uncertainty.

Based on prior research and wide consultation, a survey instrument specifically relevant to U.S. conditions was designed and tested. Through its Current Population Survey (CPS), the U.S. Bureau of the Census has fielded this instrument each year since 1995. A measurement scale was derived from the data through fitting, testing and validating a Rasch scale. The unidimensional Rasch model corresponds to the form of the phenomenon being measured, i.e., the severity of food insufficiency due to inadequate resources as directly experienced and reported in U.S. households. A categorical measure reflecting designated ranges of severity on the scale was constructed for consistent comparison of prevalence estimates over time and across population groups. The technical basis and initial results of the new measure were reported in September 1997. For the 12 months ending April 1995, an estimated 11.9\% of U.S. households (35 million persons) were food insecure. Among these, 4.1\% of households (with 6.9 million adults and 4.3 million children) showed a recurring pattern of hunger due to inadequate resources for one or more of their adult and/or child members sometime during the period. The new measure has been incorporated into other federal surveys and is being used by researchers throughout the U.S. and Canada.},

Physical activity in daily life can be categorized into occupational, sports, conditioning, household, or other activities. Exercise is a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured, and repetitive and has as a final or an intermediate objective the improvement or maintenance of physical fitness. Physical fitness is a set of attributes that are either health- or skill-related. The degree to which people have these attributes can be measured with specific tests.

The assessment of excessive exercise among athletes is a challenge because, compared to non-athletes, athletes are required to train at higher intensities and for longer periods of time. However, individuals participating in competitive sports are still susceptible to unhealthy physical-activity patterns. Most ED assessments were developed and normed in non-athlete samples and, therefore, do not capture the nuances of athletes' training experiences. The purpose of the current study was to develop and validate a clinically useful, self-report measure of unhealthy training behaviors and beliefs in athletes, the Athletes' Relationships with Training Scale (ART). Method The initial item pool was administered to N = 267 women collegiate athletes who were participating in an ED prevention program study and N = 65 women athletes who were in ED treatment. Results Factor analyses indicated the ART had a four-factor structure. Factorial and construct validity of the ART were demonstrated. ART scores significantly predicted health care utilization and differed between athletes with an ED versus athletes without an ED. For athletes in ED treatment, ART scores significantly decreased from treatment admission to discharge. Discussion The ART showed evidence of strong psychometric properties and clinical utility. The ART could be helpful for clinicians and athletic trainers to help gauge whether athletes are engaging in unhealthy training practices that may warrant clinical attention and for tracking clinical outcomes in athletes with EDs who are receiving treatment.},

We aimed to examine the association between exercise and mental health burden in a large sample, and to better understand the influence of exercise type, frequency, duration, and intensity. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we analysed data from 1 237 194 people aged 18 years or older in the USA from the 2011, 2013, and 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System survey. We compared the number of days of bad self-reported mental health between individuals who exercised and those who did not, using an exact non-parametric matching procedure to balance the two groups in terms of age, race, gender, marital status, income, education level, body-mass index category, self-reported physical health, and previous diagnosis of depression. We examined the effects of exercise type, duration, frequency, and intensity using regression methods adjusted for potential confounders, and did multiple sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Individuals who exercised had 1.49 (43.2\%) fewer days of poor mental health in the past month than individuals who did not exercise but were otherwise matched for several physical and sociodemographic characteristics (W=7.42 x 10(10), p{$<$}2.2 x 10(-16)). All exercise types were associated with a lower mental health burden (minimum reduction of 11.8\% and maximum reduction of 22.3\%) than not exercising (p{$<$}2.2 x 10(-16) for all exercise types). The largest associations were seen for popular team sports (22.3\% lower), cycling (21.6\% lower), and aerobic and gym activities (20.1\% lower), as well as durations of 45 min and frequencies of three to five times per week. INTERPRETATION: In a large US sample, physical exercise was significantly and meaningfully associated with self-reported mental health burden in the past month. More exercise was not always better. Differences as a function of exercise were large relative to other demographic variables such as education and income. Specific types, durations, and frequencies of exercise might be more effective clinical targets than others for reducing mental health burden, and merit interventional study.

Design International survey of six large nationally representative cross sectional studies on growth. Setting Brazil, Great Britain, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United States. Subjects 97 876 males and 94 851 females from birth to 25 years. Main outcome measure Body mass index (BMI, weight/ height2). Results The World Health Organization defines grade 2 thinness in adults as BMI {$<$}17. This same cut off, applied to the six datasets at age 18 years, gave mean BMI close to a z score of -2 and 80\% of the median. Thus it matches existing criteria for wasting in children based on weight for height. For each dataset, centile curves were drawn to pass through the cut off of BMI 17 at 18 years. The resulting curves were averaged to provide age and sex specific cut-off points from 2-18 years. Similar cut offs were derived based on BMI 16 and 18.5 at 18 years, together providing definitions of thinness grades 1, 2, and 3 in children and adolescents consistent with the WHO adult definitions. Conclusions The proposed cut-off points should help to provide internationally comparable prevalence rates of thinness in children and adolescents.},

This gap is due to the absence of a psychometrically sound measure of IU in youth. The present study adapted parallel child- and parent-report forms of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) and examined the internal consistency, convergent validity, and classification properties of these forms in youth aged 7\textendash 17 (M = 11.6 years, SD = 2.6). Participating youth (N = 197; 100 girls, 97 boys) either met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder (n = 73) or were nonreferred community participants (n = 124). The child-report form (i.e., IUS for Children, or IUSC), and to a lesser extent the parent-report form, demonstrated strong internal consistency and convergent validity, evidenced by significant associations with anxiety and worry (and reassurance-seeking in the case of the child-report form). Children diagnosed with anxiety disorders scored higher than nonreferred community youth on both forms. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated acceptable overall utility in distinguishing the 2 groups of youth. Findings provide preliminary support for use of the IUSC for continuous measurement of children's ability to tolerate uncertainty. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

To date, no comprehensive theoretical model exists to describe pathological exercise in the context of AN, and as such, few treatments are effective at promoting direct and sustained pathological exercise extinction. Using a framework put forth by Wise \& Koob (2014), debating the relative importance of positive and negative reinforcement in substance use, we present three hypotheses of behavioral reinforcement of exercise, encompassing biological, psychological, and environmental influences. Specifically, we argue that exercise is positively reinforced through receipt of biological and behavioral rewards, negatively reinforced through avoidance of aversive emotions, and that these two systems work in tandem over time to engrain pathological exercise as a habit. We then present suggestions for testing each of these hypotheses as future directions for the field.},

The current study represents the first external validation of the EPSI as well as the first to examine the factor structure in an outpatient eating disorder clinic sample. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis in three separate samples: an outpatient clinic sample (n\,=\,284), a college sample (n\,=\,296), and a community sample (n\,=\,341) and compared the observed factor structures to the original 8-factor solution proposed by Forbush et al. (2013). We also investigated whether the subscales correlated with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and a clinical impairment measure among the outpatient clinic sample. Results suggested between 7 and 8 factors for each of the three samples. Our findings largely replicated those of the original EPSI development study, excepting some deviations in the Muscle Building, Cognitive Restraint, and Excessive Exercise subscales. However, confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling produced poor model fit, which may be related to the item heterogeneity within many of the subscales. Finally, eating disorder attitudes and behaviors assessed by the EPSI were significantly correlated with the EDE-Q and with clinical impairment. Overall, our results highlight both strengths and limitations of the EPSI. Findings provide preliminary support for the use of the EPSI among research with diverse populations, and present several avenues for future research for enhancing clinical utility.},

Individual concurrent probing techniques using standardized probes were utilized to assess understanding of the items with 20 African American children (10 males, 10 females, aged 11\textendash 13 y). Item wording and response sets were revised, and small groups of boys (n = 5) and girls (n = 14) aged 12\textendash 15 y were asked to complete the 9-item survey. Retrospective probing techniques were then used to assess comprehension of items and response sets. Nine items were then piloted in a middle school using a self-administered format. Three hundred forty-five surveys were returned. The majority of the students were between 12 and 15 y (n = 215). Scaling analysis of the 345 completed surveys using statistical methods based on the Rasch measurement model indicated that the module measured a single underlying phenomenon (food insecurity) with sufficient reliability to be a useful tool. The measurable range of food insecurity was about 6 times the estimated measurement error, indicating that the scale could identify 3 categories of food security with reasonable reliability. A survey instrument that reliably measures food security status of individual children can provide researchers with an important tool to assess more accurately the individual-level effects of food security on nutritional status and mental and physical health among this population.},

Method: The PANAS was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,003). Competing models of the latent structure of the PANAS were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression and correlational analysis were used to determine the influence of demographic variables on PANAS scores as well as the relationship between the PANAS with measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the DASS). Results: The best-fitting model (robust comparative fit index = .94) of the latent structure of the PANAS consisted of two correlated factors corresponding to the PA and NA scales, and permitted correlated error between items drawn from the same mood subcategories (Zevon \& Tellegen, 1982). Demographic variables had only very modest influences on PANAS scores and the PANAS exhibited measurement invariance across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the PANAS was high, and the pattern of relationships between the PANAS and the DASS and HADS were consistent with tripartite theory. Conclusion: The PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess, although the hypothesis of complete independence between PA and NA must be rejected. The utility of this measure is enhanced by the provision of large-scale normative data.},

Method Compulsive exercising to control shape and weight, defined according to a modified version of the Intense Exercising to Control Shape or Weight section of the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), was assessed in 165 consecutive ED inpatients entering a protocol based on the transdiagnostic cognitive behavior theory and treatment of EDs. Baseline assessment also included anthropometry, the global EDE interview, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Eating Disorders Inventory\textendash Perfectionism Scale, and the Temperament and Character Inventory. Results Of the patients, 45.5\% were classified as compulsive exercisers, the prevalence being highest (80\%) in restricting-type anorexia nervosa (AN), lowest in EDs not otherwise specified (31.9\%), and intermediate in binge/purging AN (43.3\%) and in purging-type bulimia nervosa (39.3\%). Compulsive exercising to control shape and weight was independently predicted by the EDE restraint score (odds ratio, 1.32; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06-1.64; P = .014) after adjustment for ED; the total amount of exercise was associated with EDE restraint, as well as with the Temperament and Character Inventory reward dependence. At follow-up, an improved EDE global score was predicted by lower baseline values, higher baseline STAI and STAI improvement, and lower amount of exercise in the last 4 weeks. Voluntary treatment discontinuation was not predicted by baseline exercise. Discussion Compulsive exercising to control shape and weight is a behavioral feature of restricting-type AN, associated with restraint and temperament dimensions, with influence on treatment outcome.},

We hypothesized that GAD but not PD symptoms at the age of 15 years are associated with depression diagnosis at 18 years. METHOD:  Using longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort we examined relationships of GAD and PD symptoms (measured by the Development and Well-Being Assessment) at 15 years with depression at 18 years (by the Clinical Interview Schedule - Revised) using logistic regression. We excluded adolescents already depressed at 15 years and adjusted for social class, maternal education, birth order, gender, alcohol intake and smoking. We repeated these analyses following multiple imputation for missing data. RESULTS:  In the sample with complete data (n = 2835), high and moderate GAD symptoms in adolescents not depressed at 15 years were associated with increased risk of depression at 18 years both in unadjusted analyses and adjusting for PD symptoms at 15 years and the above potential confounders. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for depression at 18 years in adolescents with high relative to low GAD scores was 5.2 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.0-9.1, overall p {$<$} 0.0001]. There were no associations between PD symptoms and depression at 18 years in any model (high relative to low PD scores, adjusted OR = 1.3, 95\% CI 0.3-4.8, overall p = 0.737). Missing data imputation strengthened the relationship of GAD symptoms with depression (high relative to low GAD scores, OR = 6.2, 95\% CI 3.9-9.9) but those for PD became weaker. CONCLUSIONS:  Symptoms of GAD but not PD at 15 years are associated with depression at 18 years. Clinicians should be aware that adolescents with GAD symptoms may develop depression.}

Obsessive-compulsive personality (OCP) traits are also important risk factors for AN. Since excessive exercise has also been associated with greater obsessionality, we hypothesised that AN patients with a hyperactive behavioural profile represent a phenotype more closely linked to OCD than their non-exercising counterparts. We examined prospectively 50 female AN-Restrictor patients whom we classified as "excessive" or "non-excessive" based on their exercise status i) at admission and ii) over the lifetime of their illness. Validated measures of OCD symptoms and OCP traits were obtained at admission and after refeeding at discharge. On both classification methods, excessive exercisers had greater OCD symptoms and OCP traits than the non-excessive group, but did not differ on body mass index. OCD symptoms, but not OCP traits, decreased between admission and discharge. Findings support our prediction that AN patients with excessive physical activity constitute a subtype of the disorder with strong links to OCD. Indeed, this phenotype may be a culture-bound variant of OCD.},

We studied the trajectories of their development in non-binge eating and non-purging girls during early adolescence. Using a longitudinal design, we assessed 564 girls six times over the three years of middle school (grades 6 through 8) and developed trajectories specifying different developmental patterns in relation to the behaviors. Prior to this period, when the girls were in 5th grade (elementary school), we assessed risk factors to predict girls' subsequent trajectory group membership. Compensatory exercise trajectory groups included a non-engagement group, a group that increased in the behavior, and a group that decreased in the behavior. There were two fasting trajectory groups, one consistently engaging in the behavior and the other consistently not. Elementary school levels of depression, eating expectancies, and thinness expectancies predicted subsequent trajectory group membership. Risk for compensatory exercise and fasting should be evaluated as early as in 5th grade. Targeted interventions should focus on girls in late elementary school or middle school, as this appears to be a critical developmental and maintenance period for compensatory exercise and fasting behavior.},

Participants indicated the extent to which they agreed with nine statements about thin people (e.g., thin people are smart) and the same statements about fat people (e.g., fat people are smart). Predictors of fat stereotypes that were examined include weight status (BMI; girls and parents), education (parents), income (parents), self-investment in physical appearance (parents), maladaptive eating attitudes (girls), and parenting practices and peer interactions focused on body shape and weight loss (girls). Results:Girls and parents exhibited fat stereotypes. Fathers who were more educated and had a higher family income were more likely to endorse fat stereotypes, as were mothers and fathers with a high investment in their physical appearance. Although no associations were found between girls' and parents' fat stereotypes, girls were more likely to endorse fat stereotypes when interactions with parents and peers focused on body shape and weight loss. Girls were also more likely to endorse fat stereotypes when they reported higher levels of maladaptive eating attitudes. No associations were found between weight status and fat stereotypes. Discussion:Although there was no association between girls' and parents' fat stereotypes, girls were more likely to express negative attitudes about obesity and obese persons when parenting practices and interactions with peers promoted a lean body type, suggesting that there may be an implicit link between the lean ideal and fat stereotypes.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence both from animal experimentation and from clinical field studies that physical activity can play a central role in the pathogenesis of some eating disorders. However, few studies have addressed the issue of prevalence or whether there are different rates of occurrence across diagnostic categories, and the estimates that do exist are not entirely satisfactory. The present study was designed to conduct a detailed examination of the physical activity history in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) both during and prior to the onset of their disorder. A sample of adult patients and a second sample of adolescent AN patients took part in the study. A series of chi-square analyses compared diagnostic groups on a number of variables related to sport/exercise behaviors both premorbidly and comorbidly. Data were obtained by means of a detailed structured interview with each patient. We found that a large proportion of eating disorder patients were exercising excessively during an acute phase of the disorder, overexercising is significantly more frequent among those with AN versus BN, and premorbid activity levels significantly predict excessive exercise comorbidity. These findings underscore the centrality of physical activity in the development and maintenance of some eating disorders. They also have important clinical implications in light of the large proportion of individuals who combine dieting and exercise in an attempt to lose weight, and the increasing recognition of the adverse effects of strenuous physical activity in malnourished individuals.},

Hospitalized eating disordered patients and an age-matched control group were assessed. Historical and current physical activity data were collected. An in-depth interview was also conducted to ascertain the age of onset of the diagnostic symptoms for eating disorders, and to determine whether: (               i               ) exercising predated dieting; (               ii               ) patients had been involved in competitive athletics; (               iii               ) exercise was excessive; and (               iv               ) weight loss was inversely related to level of exercise. The results indicated that patients were more physically active than controls from adolescence onwards,               and               prior to the onset of the primary diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. A content analysis of the interview data indicated that 78\% of patients engaged in excessive exercise, 60\% were competitive athletes prior to the onset of their disorder, 60\% reported that sport or exercise pre-dated dieting, and 75\% claimed that physical activity levels steadily increased during the period when food intake and weight loss decreased the most. Together our results suggest that overactivity should not be routinely viewed as a secondary symptom in anorexia nervosa, equivalent to other behaviours. For a number of anorexic women, sport/exercise is an integral part of the pathogenesis and progression of self-starvation.},

  abstract = {The diminished capacity to experience pleasure or reward ("anhedonia") has its biological underpinnings in the mesolimbic dopamine system and is strongly implicated in risk for a variety of addictive behaviors. The present study tested the prediction that patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) would be more anhedonic than those with bulimia nervosa (BN)-a factor that could contribute to their respective avoidance and approach relationship to food. We also tested the idea that anhedonia would be correlated with high-level exercising from the viewpoint that the latter serves as a compensatory behavior for a blunted affect. AN patients of the restrictor subtype (n = 78) and BN patients with no history of AN (n = 76) were included in the regression analyses. Patients were also classified as excessive exercisers or moderate/nonexercisers according to information gathered during a structured clinical interview. Findings were largely supportive of our predictions. AN patients were highly anhedonic compared to BN patients, and excessive exercisers tended to be more anhedonic than those who did not exercise. We discuss the AN-BN differences in capacity for reward/pleasure in the context of the common psychobiological links between the eating disorders and drug and alcohol addiction, and speculate on how these differences might relate to the etiology and pathophysiology of both AN and BN.},

The theory focuses on types, rather than just amount, of motivation, paying particular attention to autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and amotivation as predictors of performance, relational, and well-being outcomes. It also addresses the social conditions that enhance versus diminish these types of motivation, proposing and finding that the degrees to which basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are supported versus thwarted affect both the type and strength of motivation. SDT also examines people's life goals or aspirations, showing differential relations of intrinsic versus extrinsic life goals to performance and psychological health. In this introduction we also briefly discuss recent developments within SDT concerning mindfulness and vitality, and highlight the applicability of SDT within applied domains, including work, relationships, parenting, education, virtual environments, sport, sustainability, health care, and psychotherapy.

Specifically, during the aging process, physical exercise might represent a potential adjunctive treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment, helping delay the onset of neurodegenerative processes. Even though exercise itself might act as a stressor, it has been demonstrated that it reduces the harmful effects of other stressors when performed at moderate intensities. Neurotransmitter release, neurotrophic factor and neurogenesis, and cerebral blood flow alteration are some of the concepts involved. In this review, the potential effects of exercise on the aging process and on mental health are discussed, concerning some of the recent findings on animal and human research. The overwhelming evidence present in the literature today suggests that exercise ensures successful brain functioning.}

Factor analyses revealed two subscales for the newly developed Function of Exercise Scale (FES): Weight and Appearance (WA), and Health and Enjoyment (HE). FES-HE scores correlated with better psychological well-being and predicted prospectively monitored as well as concurrently and longitudinally assessed exercise behavior. FES-HE scores also correlated with lower pulse, systolic blood pressure, and salivary cortisol readings, indicating its association with better physical health. In contrast, FES-WA scores correlated with greater depressive and eating disorder symptoms, as well as lower self-esteem, and predicted the later emergence of eating disorder, but not depressive, symptoms. FES-WA scores failed to show a relationship with measures of physical well-being, including exercise engagement and vital sign data. Overall, the FES appears to hold promise as a succinct and psychometrically sound heuristic for meaningfully relating exercise motivations to important indices of both physical and psychological well-being.},

METHODS AND PROCEDURES: An Internet sample was recruited through online community discussion groups and snowball sampling via e-mail. Women (n = 164) and men (n = 34) with a BMI {$>$} 25 kg/m2 completed the WBIS and the Antifat Attitudes Questionnaire (AAQ), as well as measures of self-esteem, body image, mood disturbance, drive for thinness, and binge eating. RESULTS: Results indicate that the WBIS had high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.90) and correlated significantly with antifat attitudes but was not a completely overlapping construct (r = 0.31). The scale showed strong partial correlations with self-esteem (r = -0.67), drive for thinness (r = 0.47), and body image concern (r = 0.75), controlling for BMI. Internalized weight bias was also significantly correlated with measures of mood and eating disturbance. Multiple regression analyses were conducted using WBIS scores, antifat attitudes, and BMI as predictor variables of body image, mood, self-esteem, and binge eating. WBIS scores were found to significantly predict scores on each of these measures. DISCUSSION: The WBIS showed excellent psychometric properties and construct validity. The study highlights the importance of distinguishing antifat attitudes toward others from internalized weight bias, a construct that may be closely linked with psychopathology.},

These measures, in various forms, are used to inform national programs and policies related to food insecurity. Data for low-income households with children from recent administrations of the HFSSM (2012-2014) are used in this study (N = 7,324). The results suggest that there are detectable levels of misfit with Infit mean square error (MSE) statistics ranging from 6.73 \% to 21.33\% and Outfit MSE statistics ranging from 5.31\% to 9.68\%. The data suggest for Outfit MSE statistics that (a) male respondents, (b) respondents with lower levels of education, and (c) respondents who did not report participating in SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly the Food Stamp Program) tend to have more misfit. For Infit MSE statistics, lack of homeownership appears to be a predictor of misfit. The implications of this research for future research, theory, and policy related to the measurement of household food insecurity are discussed.},

Oxygen consumption was measured on a breath-by-breath basis, and accelerometer data were collected in 15-s epochs. Using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, cutpoints that maximised both sensitivity and specificity were determined for sedentary, moderate and vigorous activities. For both accelerometers, discrimination of sedentary behaviour was almost perfect, with the area under the ROC curve at or exceeding 0.98. For both the ActiGraph and Actical, the discrimination of moderate (0.85 and 0.86, respectively) and vigorous activity (0.83 and 0.86, respectively) was acceptable, but not as precise as for sedentary behaviour.

Of the 202 participants who met the inclusion criteria and completed the online survey, 65\% were at risk of LEA, 23\% were at risk of exercise addiction, and 21\% had DE. Athletes at risk of LEA had higher EDE-Q and EAI scores compared to athletes with low risk. EAI score remained higher in athletes with risk of LEA after excluding athletes with DE. Athletes at risk of LEA did not report more food intolerances (17 vs. 10\%, P = 0.198), but were more frequently reported by athletes with DE (28 vs. 11\%, P = 0.004). In conclusion, these athletes had a high risk of LEA, exercise addiction, and DE.

RESULTS: There was some over-reporting of bulimic behaviors on the 1998 questionnaire (asking about 1997-1998) compared with the interview that may have been due to the shorter and nonoverlapping time frame in the interview compared with the questionnaire. Despite the overestimation, the questionnaire did an excellent job at classifying girls who did not purge (negative predictive values [NPV]: 0.99) or binge eat (NPV = 0.98). When purging on the interview was compared with purging on either the 1998 or 1999 questionnaires, the sensitivity increased substantially from 0.73 to 0.93.

A search strategy was developed to identify all studies of adolescents with eating disorders, in which the prevalence and/or psychological correlates of compulsive exercise had been formally assessed through clinical interview or reliable and valid clinical measures. A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, of which 10 studies provided comparable prevalence estimates and 4 studies identified psychopathological correlates of compulsive exercise. For the relevant data, the prevalence of compulsive exercise in adolescents with eating disorders ranged from 16.7\% to 85.3\%. There is some evidence to suggest that compulsive exercise is associated with increased eating disorder symptomology and anxiety; however, other relationships remain unclear with studies producing disparate results. The results from the studies reviewed suggest that compulsive exercise is an evident problem within adolescent eating disorders; however, the specific psychopathological risks associated with this behaviour cannot be reliably summarised.},

The goal of this study was to overcome these limitations through the development of a comprehensive multidimensional measure of eating pathology. An initial pool of 160 items was developed to assess 20 dimensions of eating pathology. The initial item pool was administered to a student sample (N = 433) and community sample (N = 407) to determine the preliminary structure of the measure using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The revised measure was administered to independent samples of patients recruited from specialty ED treatment centers (N = 158), outpatient psychiatric clinics (N = 303), and students (N = 227). Analyses revealed an 8-factor structure characterized by Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Excessive Exercise, Restricting, Purging, Muscle Building, and Negative Attitudes Toward Obesity. Scale scores showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity; other analyses demonstrated that the majority of scales were invariant across sex and weight categories. Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory scale scores had excellent internal consistency (median coefficient alphas ranged from .84\textendash.89) and reliability over a 2- to 4-week period (mean retest r = .73). The current study represents one of the most comprehensive scale development projects ever conducted in the field of EDs and will enhance future basic and treatment research focused on EDs.

All pregnant women resident in a defined area in the South West of England, with an expected date of delivery between 1st April 1991 and 31st December 1992, were eligible and 13\,761 women (contributing 13\,867 pregnancies) were recruited. These women have been followed over the last 19\textendash 22 years and have completed up to 20 questionnaires, have had detailed data abstracted from their medical records and have information on any cancer diagnoses and deaths through record linkage. A follow-up assessment was completed 17\textendash 18 years postnatal at which anthropometry, blood pressure, fat, lean and bone mass and carotid intima media thickness were assessed, and a fasting blood sample taken. The second follow-up clinic, which additionally measures cognitive function, physical capability, physical activity (with accelerometer) and wrist bone architecture, is underway and two further assessments with similar measurements will take place over the next 5 years. There is a detailed biobank that includes DNA, with genome-wide data available on {$>$}10\,000, stored serum and plasma taken repeatedly since pregnancy and other samples; a wide range of data on completed biospecimen assays are available. Details of how to access these data are provided in this cohort profile.},

There is little literature, however, examining the relationship between compensatory exercise and thinness expectancies. The goal of the current study was to examine whether thinness expectancies contribute significant variance in the endorsement of excessive exercise over and above binge eating, restraint, and shape and weight concerns. A total of 677 undergraduate women (mean age=18.73) completed self-report measures of thinness expectancies and eating disorder symptoms (TREI and EDE-Q). There was a significant association between thinness expectancies and frequency of compensatory exercise behavior. Restraint and subjective binge episodes accounted for significant variance in compensatory exercise. Frequency of objective binge episodes did not, nor did endorsement of thinness expectancies. These findings suggest a potential profile of individuals engaging in compensatory exercise as individuals who actively restrict their diets, feel as if they have binged when they violate those restrictions, and feel the need to excessively exercise to compensate for the subjective binges.},

To date, there are comprehensive data on approximately 10,000 children and their parents, from early pregnancy until the children are aged between 8 and 9. The study aims to continue to collect detailed data on the children as they go through puberty noting, in particular, changes in anthropometry, attitudes and behaviour, fitness and other cardiovascular risk factors, bone mineralisation, allergic symptoms and mental health. The study started early during pregnancy and collected very detailed data from the mother and her partner before the child was born. This not only provided accurate data on concurrent features, especially medication, symptoms, diet and lifestyle, attitudes and behaviour, social and environmental features, but was unbiased by parental knowledge of any problems that the child might develop. From the time of the child's birth many different aspects of the child's environment have been monitored and a wide range of phenotypic data collected. By virtue of being based in one geographic area, linkage to medical and educational records is relatively simple, and hands-on assessments of children and parents using local facilities has the advantage of high quality control. The comprehensiveness of the ALSPAC approach with a total population sample unselected by disease status, and the availability of parental genotypes, provides an adequate sample for statistical analysis and for avoiding spurious results. The study has an open policy in regard to collaboration within strict confidentiality rules.}

Convergent and discriminant validity were examined in baseline ratings from three cohorts of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (N = 81). The total Yale-Brown Scale score was significantly correlated with two of three independent measures of obsessive-compulsive disorder and weakly correlated with measures of depression and of anxiety in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder with minimal secondary depressive symptoms. Results from a previously reported placebo-controlled trial of fluvoxamine in 42 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder showed that the Yale-Brown Scale was sensitive to drug-induced changes and that reductions in Yale-Brown Scale scores specifically reflected improvement in obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms. Together, these studies indicate that the 10-item Yale-Brown Scale is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing obsessive-compulsive disorder symptom severity and that it is suitable as an outcome measure in drug trials of obsessive-compulsive disorder.},

Methods The sample consisted of 1012 adolescents aged 12\textendash 14 years old, who completed the CET, the Commitment to Exercise Scale (CES), and selected subscales from the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2). Results Results confirmed the original five-factor solution of the CET. The CET's concurrent validity with the CES, as well as the convergent validity with the EDI-2, was established. The CET was not strongly related to exercise frequency. Conclusion The CET appears to be valid and reliable for use with adolescents.

  title = {Visualizing Transitions with the {{transitionPlot}} Function | {{R-bloggers}}},
  author = {Gordon, Max},
  year = {2013},
  month = jun,
  abstract = {A transition between states - the above is a simulation of before and after surgery where I've highlighted the large proportion that doesn't improve in the moderate group. As an orthopaedic surgeon I'm often interested in how a patient is doing after surgery compared to before. I call this as a transition between states, e.g. severe pain to moderate pain, and in order to better illustrate these transitions I've created something that I call a transition plot. It's closely related to the plotMat for plotting networks but aimed at less complex relations with only a one-way relation between two groups of states. This project started by me posting a question on Stack Overflow, the answers were (as always) excellent, but didn't really satisfy my needs. What I wanted was a graphically appealing plot that I could control in extreme detail. Thanks to Paul Murrell's excellent grid package I was able to generate a truly customizeable transition plot. In this post I'll give a short introduction with examples to what you can do with the transitionPlot()-function. I'll try to walk you through simple transitions to more complex ones with group proportions and highlighted arrows. Simulate some data To illustrate a simple example we'll generate some data, imagine having a questionnaire for pre- and postoperative pain graded none, moderate, or major. We have the two variables in our data set, and to see the relation we just do a three-by-three table: library(Gmisc) library(Gmisc) \# Generate some fake data set.seed(9730) b4 Transitions None Moderate Major None 13 33 8 Moderate 50 107 30 Major 78 131 50 Simple example This is interpretable, but understanding the flow can be challenging and time-consuming. Visualizing it using the transition plot gives a quick and more intuitive understanding: transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx) Here you can see the thick lines representing the transition from that particular group into the next. So far I've used the graph for the same measure on left and right side but I guess your imagination sets the limit. It can just as well be two or more treatment arms with some discrete outcomes. Simple with a twist In my previous post I documented how I created an arrow that allows perfect control over start, stop and width. Another annoying detail in the default bezier line, is that the arrows are perpendicular to each box, thus not following the line contour as expected. If we change the arrow type to my alternative arrow we get a nicer plot: \# Note that when using my arrow type you need to specify exact unit width \# since I wasn't certain how the lwd should be translated. transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "simple", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Note that I've also added a white background to each arrow in order to visually separate the arrows (the overlay order can be customized with the overlap\_order parameter). To further enhance the transition feeling I have added the option of a color gradient. To do this you need to specify arrow\_type = ``gradient'': \# Note that when using my arrow type you need to specify exact unit width \# since I wasn't certain how the lwd should be translated. transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) More complex coloring Additionally you can choose different colors for your boxes: library(RColorBrewer) transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, txt\_start\_clr = "black", txt\_end\_clr = "black", fill\_start\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Pastel1"), fill\_end\_box = brewer.pal(n = 6, name = "Pastel1")[4:6], overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Split boxes into proportions Sometimes you might want to split the color of each box into two colors, illustrating a proportion, for instance if we do wrist fracture surgery it might be interesting to explore if the left:right ratio differs. Note that the gradient color is a blend between the two proportions: transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, box\_prop = cbind(c(0.3, 0.7, 0.5), c(0.5, 0.5, 0.4)), txt\_start\_clr = c("black", "white"), txt\_end\_clr = c("black", "white"), fill\_start\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Paired")[1:2], fill\_end\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Paired")[1:2], overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Highlighting certain arrows Another interesting option may be to highlight a certain transition: arr\_clrs Summary Even though it may seem like a very simple plot, after some tweaking I believe the data-per-ink ratio turns out quite OK. I hope you'll find it as useful as I have. As always, don't hesitate to comment. The function transitionPlot is included in my Gmisc-package.},

METHODS: Physical activity and food restriction during the last 3 months and status of body image/slimness ideal were assessed by the Structured Interview of Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa (SIAB) in 30 adolescent patients with acute AN at admission to inpatient treatment. Anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsiveness were assessed with the Symptom Check-List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). A regression model based on the independent variables body mass index, food reduction, body image/slimness ideal, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsiveness was calculated to determine the relevant prediction variables of physical activity. RESULTS: The regression model explained 64\% (R(2) = .64, p = .000) of the variance of physical activity. Only food restriction (p = .006) and anxiety (p = .004) contributed significantly to the variance. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that anxiety symptoms and food restriction synergistically contribute to increased levels of physical activity in the acute phase of AN.},

  abstract = {Low leptin levels are an endocrinological hallmark of acute anorexia nervosa (AN); a subthreshold leptin secretion in adipocytes as a consequence of a reduced energy intake is presumed to be the major trigger of the adaptation of an organism to semistarvation. The aim of the current study is to define symptoms of AN that are potentially linked to low leptin levels. For this purpose, quantitative somatic and psychopathological variables were obtained in 61 inpatients with acute AN (study group 1) upon referral for inpatient treatment, and they were concomitantly blood sampled to allow determination of serum leptin levels. Correlations between these variables and logarithmic transformed (lg10) leptin levels were descriptively assessed. Apart from the well-known correlations between leptin levels and anthropometric measurements, the strongest correlation was observed between lg10 serum leptin levels and expert ratings of motor restlessness (r = -0.476; nominal P = 0.003) upon use of visual analog scales. We thus generated the hypothesis that physical activity levels in AN patients are related to serum leptin levels. This hypothesis was tested in an independent study group of 27 adolescent inpatients (study group 2) who were also assessed upon referral. Physical activity levels, which, in this study group, were assessed with the activity module of the expert rating form of the Structured Inventory for Anorexic and Bulimic Syndromes, were significantly correlated with lg10 leptin levels (r = -0.51; one-sided P = 0.006). A regression model based on the independent variables body mass index and lg10 leptin levels explained 37\% of the variance of physical activity (R(2) = 0.37; P = 0.003); only the lg10 leptin levels contributed significantly to the variance (P = 0.003). Our results suggest that, similar to semistarvation-induced hyperactivity in rats, hypoleptinemia in patients with AN may be one important factor underlying the excessive physical activity.}

Leptin ameliorates anxiety-related movement in ob/ob mice. In this study, we assessed the relationship between leptin and qualities of physical activity and restlessness in acute anorexia nervosa (AN). METHODS:  Serum leptin, body mass index (BMI), \% body fat, and self- and expert-ratings of qualities of physical activity and restlessness were assessed in 26 inpatients with acute AN. Accelerometry was also performed. Regression analyses were used to predict activity and restlessness using BMI, \% body fat, and leptin levels as predictor variables. RESULTS:  Leptin levels significantly contributed to the prediction of all measures of activity and restlessness. CONCLUSIONS:  This is the first study linking hypoleptinemia in AN patients to subjective and objective measures of higher physical activity and motor and inner restlessness. Leptin may directly or indirectly (or both) influence behaviors and cognitions contributing to hyperactivity and motor restlessness.}

Method: Fifty-Seven adolescents (mean age 15.7 years) who attended consecutive assessments at a specialist eating disorders clinic completed the DAWBA, the EDE, and a standard clinical assessment with a multidisciplinary team. Cohen's Kappas were used to make pairwise comparisons between the diagnoses generated by the three assessments. Results: Participants had anorexia nervosa (n = 30), eating disorders NOS (n = 21) or no eating disorder (n = 6) according to the clinical diagnosis. Agreement between the clinical and DAWBA diagnoses was moderate ({$\kappa$} = 0.59), agreement between the DAWBA and EDE diagnoses was fair ({$\kappa$} = 0.21), and agreement between the clinical and EDE diagnoses was poor ({$\kappa$} = 0.10). The EDE did not identify an eating disorder in 20 participants (35\% of the sample) who were clinically assessed as cases. Conclusion: Computerized measures using multiple informants may be more suitable for assessing clinical samples of adolescents with anorexia nervosa or eating disorders NOS than individual interviews with young people. \textcopyright{} 2008 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The primary aim of the present study was to quantify the incidence of overweight and obesity throughout childhood and adolescence in a large contemporary cohort of English children (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC; children born 1991\textendash 1992). A secondary aim was to examine the persistence of overweight and obesity. Methods Longitudinal data on weight and height were collected annually from age 7\textendash 15years in the entire ALSPAC cohort (n=4283), and from 3 to 15years in a randomly selected subsample of the cohort (n=549; `Children in Focus' CiF). Incidence of overweight and obesity (BMI (Body mass index) at or above the 85th and 95th centiles relative to UK reference data) was calculated. Risk ratios (RR) for overweight and obesity at 15years based on weight status at 3, 7, and 11years were also calculated. Results In the entire cohort, four-year incidence of obesity was higher between ages 7 and 11years than between 11 and 15years (5.0\% vs 1.4\% respectively). In the CiF sub-sample, four-year incidence of obesity was also highest during mid-childhood (age 7\textendash 11years, 6.7\%), slightly lower during early childhood (3\textendash 7years, 5.1\%) and lowest during adolescence (11\textendash 15years 1.6\%). Overweight and obesity at all ages had a strong tendency to persist to age 15years as indicated by risk ratios (95\% CI (Confidence interval)) for overweight and obesity at 15years from overweight and obesity (relative to healthy weight status) at 3years (2.4, 1.8\textendash 3.1), 7years (4.6, 3.6\textendash 5.8), and 11years (9.3, 6.5\textendash 13.2). Conclusion Mid\textendash late childhood (around age 7\textendash 11years) may merit greater attention in future obesity prevention interventions.},

Assessing the diet of adolescents may be challenging as the behavioural factors and food habits which impact on what they eat may also affect how they report dietary intake. This study assesses factors associated with the misreporting of dietary intake.Methods: Adolescents (n = 4,844; average age 13.8 years) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) completed a 3-day diet record. Misreporting was estimated using an individualised method, and adolescents were categorised by reporting status. Foods were categorised as core and noncore foods to evaluate diet quality. Body composition measurements were recorded at a research clinic. Information on dieting, weight concern, family socioeconomic status, and parental BMI were collected via questionnaires. Binary logistic regression was performed, in boys and girls separately, to investigate factors associated with underreporting of dietary intake.Results: Girls were much more likely than boys to be dissatisfied with their weight and to diet, but showed similar levels of underreporting (\textasciitilde 67\%). In adjusted regression analysis underreporters (UR) were more likely to be overweight or obese: OR in boys 2.8 (95\% CI 1.7\textendash 4.8) and in girls 2.2 (95\% CI 1.5\textendash 3.2). Dissatisfaction with weight and dieting were positively associated, and perception of being underweight negatively associated with underreporting in boys. Perception of being overweight, dieting, and exact age were positively associated with underreporting in girls. UR obtained a greater percentage of energy from protein and a smaller percentage of energy from fat; they reported greater intake of core foods and lower intakes of non-core foods than plausible reporters.Conclusion: A large proportion of adolescents underreported their dietary energy intake. This was associated with their body weight status and body image and had a differential effect on their estimated food and macronutrient intakes. Assessment of misreporting status is essential when collecting and interpreting dietary information from adolescents.},

  abstract = {Background: Graphical techniques can provide visually compelling insights into complex data patterns. In this paper we present a type of lasagne plot showing changes in categorical variables for participants measured at regular intervals over time and propose statistical models to estimate distributions of marginal and transitional probabilities. Methods: The plot uses stacked bars to show the distribution of categorical variables at each time interval, with different colours to depict different categories and changes in colours showing trajectories of participants over time. The models are based on nominal logistic regression which is appropriate for both ordinal and nominal categorical variables. To illustrate the plots and models we analyse data on smoking status, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity level from a longitudinal study on women's health. To estimate marginal distributions we fit survey wave as an explanatory variable whereas for transitional distributions we fit status of participants (e.g. smoking status) at previous surveys. Results: For the illustrative data the marginal models showed BMI increasing, physical activity decreasing and smoking decreasing linearly over time at the population level. The plots and transition models showed smoking status to be highly predictable for individuals whereas BMI was only moderately predictable and physical activity was virtually unpredictable. Most of the predictive power was obtained from participant status at the previous survey. Predicted probabilities from the models mostly agreed with observed probabilities indicating adequate goodness-of-fit. Conclusions: The proposed form of lasagne plot provides a simple visual aid to show transitions in categorical variables over time in longitudinal studies. The suggested models complement the plot and allow formal testing and estimation of marginal and transitional distributions. These simple tools can provide valuable insights into categorical data on individuals measured at regular intervals over time.},

  abstract = {Gender stereotype theory suggests that men are generally perceived as more masculine than women, whereas women are generally perceived as more feminine than men. Several scales have been developed to measure fundamental aspects of gender stereotypes (e.g., agency and communion, competence and warmth, or instrumentality and expressivity). Although omitted in later version, Bem's original Sex Role Inventory included the items ``masculine'' and ``feminine'' in addition to more specific gender-stereotypical attributes. We argue that it is useful to be able to measure these two core concepts in a reliable, valid, and parsimonious way. We introduce a new and brief scale, the Traditional Masculinity-Femininity (TMF) scale, designed to assess central facets of self-ascribed masculinity-femininity. Studies 1\textendash 2 used known-groups approaches (participants differing in gender and sexual orientation) to validate the scale and provide evidence of its convergent validity. As expected the TMF reliably measured a one-dimensional masculinity-femininity construct. Moreover, the TMF correlated moderately with other gender-related measures. Demonstrating incremental validity, the TMF predicted gender and sexual orientation in a superior way than established adjective-based measures. Furthermore, the TMF was connected to criterion characteristics, such as judgments as straight by laypersons for the whole sample, voice pitch characteristics for the female subsample, and contact to gay men for the male subsample, and outperformed other gender-related scales. Taken together, as long as gender differences continue to exist, we suggest that the TMF provides a valuable methodological addition for research into gender stereotypes.},

The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults: behaviors that contribute to unintentional and intentional injuries, tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, sexual behaviors, unhealthy dietary behaviors, and physical inactivity. The YRBSS includes both a national school-based survey conducted by CDC and state and local school-based surveys conducted by state and local education agencies. This report summarizes results from the national survey, 35 state surveys, and 16 local surveys conducted among high school students from February through May 1995. In the United States, 72\% of all deaths among school-age youth and young adults result from four causes: motor vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 1995 YRBSS suggest that many high school students practice behaviors that may increase their likelihood of death from these four causes: 21.7\% had rarely or never used a safety belt, 38.8\% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol during the 30 days preceding the survey, 20.0\% had carried a weapon during the 30 days preceding the survey, 51.6\% had drunk alcohol during the 30 days preceding the survey, 25.3\% had used marijuana during the 30 days preceding the survey, and 8.7\% had attempted suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey. Substantial morbidity and social problems among school-age youth and young adults also result from unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection. YRBSS results indicate that in 1995, 53.1\% of high school students had experienced sexual intercourse, 45.6\% of sexually active students had not used a condom at last sexual intercourse, and 2.0\% had ever injected an illegal drug. Among adults, 65\% of all deaths result from three causes: heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Most of the risk behaviors associated with these causes of death are initiated during adolescence. In 1995, 34.8\% of high school students had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days preceding the survey, 39.5\% had eaten more than two servings of foods typically high in fat content during the day preceding the survey, and only 25.4\% had attended physical education class daily. YRBSS data are being used nationwide by health and education officials to improve national, state, and local policies and programs designed to reduce risks associated with the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. YRBSS data also are being used to measure progress toward achieving 21 national health objectives and one of eight National Education Goals.},

Specifically, the ASI-3 successfully discriminated patients with anxiety disorders from patients with nonanxiety disorders. Moreover, patients with panic disorder or agoraphobia manifested more somatic concerns than patients with other anxiety disorders and patients with nonanxiety disorders. Finally, correlations of the ASI-3 scales with other measures of clinical symptoms and negative affect substantiated convergent and discriminant validity. Substantial positive correlations were found between the ASI-3 Somatic Concerns and body vigilance, between Social Concerns and fear of negative evaluation and socially inhibited behavior, and between Cognitive Concerns and depression symptoms, anxiety, fear of negative evaluation, and subjective complaints. Moreover, Social Concerns correlated negatively with dominant and intrusive behavior. Results are discussed with respect to the contribution of the ASI-3 to the assessment of anxiety-related disorders.},

This study examined temporal relations among body surveillance, body shame, and eating disorder symptoms in the context of a dissonance-based body image intervention and through 14-month follow-up. College women (N=285) completed assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and at 8-week, 8-month, and 14-month follow-up. Cross-lag panel analyses revealed that changes in body surveillance significantly mediated the association between body shame and ED symptoms over time. Alternatively, body shame did not change over time and was not a significant mediator of associations between body surveillance and ED symptoms longitudinally. Results indicate that the ameliorative effects of dissonance-based interventions may be due to reductions in body surveillance, rather than decreased body shame.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {$>$} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

Standard approaches address this issue by means of generalized estimating equations or generalized linear mixed models with logistic links. Using an empirical example and simulated data, we show (1) that cross-level product terms from these models can produce misleading results with respect to whether the within-person rate of change varies across levels of a dichotomous between-person factor; and (2) that subgroup differences in the rate of change should be assessed on an additive scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the probability of disease) rather than on a multiplicative scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the odds of disease). Because usual approaches do not provide a significance test for whether the rate of additive change varies across levels of a between-person factor, sample differences in the rate of additive change may be due to sampling error. We illustrate how standard software can be used to estimate and test whether additive changes vary across levels of a between-person factor.},

However, it is still unclear which fears are most important (e.g., food, weight gain), which has practical implications, given treatments for eating-related fear necessitate modifications based on the specific fear driving ED pathology. For example, exposure treatments should be optimized based on specific fears that maintain pathology. The current study (N = 1,622 combined clinical ED and undergraduate sample) begins to answer questions on the precise nature of ED fears and how they operate with other ED symptoms. Method We used network analysis to create two models of ED fears and symptoms. The first model consisted of ED fears only (e.g., fears of food, fears of weight gain) to identify which fear is most central. The second model consisted of ED fears and ED symptoms to detect how ED fears operate with ED symptoms. Results We found fear of disliking how one's body feels due to weight gain, disliking eating in social situations, feeling tense around food, fear of judgment due to weight gain, and food anxiety were the most central ED fears. We also identified several bridge symptoms between ED fears and symptoms. Finally, we found that the most central ED fears predicted excessive exercise at two-month follow-up. Discussion These data support the idea that consequences (i.e., judgment) associated with fears of weight gain and interoceptive fears are the most central ED fears. These data have implications for the future development of precision interventions targeted to address ED-related fear.},

It is characterized by a craving for physical training, resulting in uncontrollable excessive exercise behavior with harmful consequences, such as injuries and impaired social relations. It has not been accepted as a mental disorder in either International Classification of Diseases or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The aim of this literature review was to critically examine the research on links (comorbidity), risks (negative consequences), and challenges faced (problems in a treatment context). This review found that compulsive exercise is associated with eating disorder pathology, perfectionism, neuroticism, narcissism, and obsessive compulsive traits. The most prominent negative consequences were injuries, social impairment, and depression, but more research is needed to uncover the potential dysfunction resulting from compulsive exercise. As the condition is not recognized as a psychiatric disorder, studies on treatment interventions are sparse. Problems with compliance have been reported; therefore, motivational interviewing has been proposed as a treatment approach, in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy. This review summarizes and discusses findings on links/comorbidity, risks/negative consequences, and treatment challenges. We suggest that future studies should pay attention to both prevention and counseling in sports settings, where compulsive exercise appears, as the condition may be associated with \-harmful consequences.},

  abstract = {Patients with eating disorders present with a wide range of eating-related preoccupations and/or rituals. Yet, eating disorder assessments traditionally have measured a finite number of specific eating-disordered thoughts or actions. The current work presents a new instrument, the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale (YBC-EDS), that does not limit assessment to a particular set of eating-related concerns or behaviors. Rather, it assesses the severity of illness associated with individual's unique symptomatology. Reliability and validity of this new, clinician-rated instrument was tested in two independent samples of DSM-III-R eating disorder patients. The YBC-EDS eight-item scale assessing severity of preoccupations and rituals, and a set of six provisional items for assessing motivation for change were both frequently endorsed and found to have excellent interrater reliability. Internal consistency was shown to be good for the set of eight core items and the set of six items related to motivation for change. The eight-item scale demonstrated aspects of convergent validity with other assessments of eating disorder symptomatology. The set of six provisional items for assessing motivation for change was inversely related to measures to diet restriction, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction. This paper presents the eight-item Yale- Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale for assessing illness severity in eating-disordered patients with an extensive range of symptomatology. An accompanying set of six provisional items for assessing motivation for change are also presented. Initial findings showed excellent reliability and indications of validity for both the eight-item YBC-EDS and the set of six provisional items.},

The male standard of bodily attractiveness, however, is bigger, bulkier, and more muscular. Are boys and men motivated to be big and muscular in the same way that girls and women are motivated to be thin? The authors constructed a 15-item survey and administered it to 197 adolescents. The findings showed that the drive for muscularity measure displayed good reliability; that individuals high in the drive were more likely to be boys who were trying to gain both weight and muscle mass; that the drive was related to poor self-esteem and higher levels of depression among boys, but not among girls; and that the drive for muscularity was relatively unrelated to the drive for thinness.}

AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of eating disorder behaviours and cognitions and associated childhood psychological, physical and parental risk factors among a cohort of 14-year-old children. METHOD: Data were collected from 6140 boys and girls aged 14 years. Gender-stratified models were used to estimate prospective associations between childhood body dissatisfaction, body mass index (BMI), self-esteem, maternal eating disorder and family economic disadvantage on adolescent eating disorder behaviours and cognitions. RESULTS: Childhood body dissatisfaction strongly predicted eating disorder cognitions in girls, but only in interaction with BMI in boys. Higher self-esteem had a protective effect, particularly in boys. Maternal eating disorder predicted body dissatisfaction and weight/shape concern in adolescent girls and dieting in boys. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for eating disorder behaviours and cognitions vary according to gender. Prevention strategies should be gender-specific and target modifiable predictors in childhood and early adolescence.},

Method Eating disorders were ascertained at 14 and 16 years of age in 6,140 youth at age 14 (58\% of those eligible) and 5,069 at age 16 (52\% of those eligible) as part of the prospective Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Outcomes (depression, anxiety disorders, binge drinking, drug use, deliberate self-harm, weight status) were measured using interviews and questionnaires about 2 years following predictors. Generalized estimating equation models adjusting for gender, socio-demographic variables, and prior outcome were used to examine prospective associations between eating disorders and each outcome. Results All eating disorders were predictive of later anxiety disorders. AN, BN, BED, PD, and OSFED were prospectively associated with depression (respectively AN: odds ratio [OR]=1.39 [95\% CIs: 1.00-1.94]; BN: OR=3.39[1.25-9.20]; BED: OR=2.00 [1.06-3.75]; PD: OR=2.56 [1.38-4.74]).

Whilst BED and BN predicted obesity (respectively OR=3.58 [1.06-12.14] and OR=6.42 [1.69-24.30]), AN was prospectively associated with underweight. Conclusions Adolescent eating disorders, including subthreshold presentations, predict negative outcomes, including mental health disorders, substance use, deliberate self-harm, and weight outcomes. This study highlights the high public health and clinical burden of eating disorders among adolescents.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cognitions and behaviors characteristic of binge eating are associated with a polymorphism in the FTO gene, robustly related to body mass index (BMI) and obesity risk. We investigated the association between binge eating and the individual and combined effect of 32 SNPs robustly associated with BMI in a population-based sample. We hypothesized that higher BMI and binge eating might share a common genetic etiology. METHODS: Binge eating was assessed in adolescents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 14 (n\,=\,5,958) and 16 years (n\,=\,4,948). We tested associations between 32 BMI-related SNPs and binge eating in crude and BMI-, age-, and gender-adjusted regression models. RESULTS: Crude analyses showed an association between binge eating and rs1558902 (FTO) that persisted after adjustment for BMI (OR\,=\,1.20, P\,=\,8 \texttimes{} 10(-3) ). A weighted allelic score consisting of all 32 BMI-related SNPs was associated with binge eating (P\,=\,8 \texttimes{} 10(-4) ); this association attenuated (P\,=\,0.08) when rs1558902 was removed from the weighted allelic score. CONCLUSIONS: BMI-related genes are associated with adolescent binge eating, in particular an FTO polymorphism. Although replication is needed, our findings have biological plausibility and are consistent with a postulated effect of FTO on appetite and food intake. Future studies should aim to understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between FTO, binge eating, and obesity.},

We aimed to derive an empirically based ED behaviour classification using behavioural and body mass index (BMI) indicators at three time-points in adolescence, and to validate classes investigating prospective associations with adverse outcomes. Adolescents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) provided data on ED at age 14 (n = 6615), 16 (n = 5888), and 18 years (n = 5100), and had weight and height measured. Psychological and behavioural outcomes were assessed at 15.5/16 and 17.5/18 years. We fit gender- and age-stratified latent class models, and employed logistic regression to investigate associations between classes and later outcomes. One asymptomatic and two symptomatic (largely representing higher and lower frequency ED behaviours) classes were observed at each time-point, although their relative prevalence varied by age and gender. The majority of girls in symptomatic classes remained symptomatic at subsequent assessments. Girls in symptomatic classes had higher odds of subsequent anxiety and depressive disorders, binge drinking, drug use, and deliberate self-harm. Data analyses were underpowered amongst boys. The presence of two symptomatic classes (characterised by different ED behaviour frequency) and their prospective association with adverse outcomes suggest a need to refine diagnostic thresholds based on empirical data. Despite some instability of classes, particularly in mid-adolescence, evidence that half of girls in symptomatic classes remained symptomatic suggests persistence of ED behaviours in adolescence, and highlights a need for early identification to reduce chronicity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:  Eating disorders (EDs) are common amongst women; however, no research has specifically investigated the lifetime/12-month prevalence of eating disorders amongst women in mid-life (i.e., fourth and fifth decade of life) and the relevant longitudinal risk factors. We aimed to investigate the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of EDs and lifetime health service use and to identify childhood, parenting, and personality risk factors. METHODS:  This is a two-phase prevalence study, nested within an existing longitudinal community-based sample of women in mid-life. A total of 5658 women from the UK Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; enrolled 20~years earlier) participated. ED diagnoses were obtained using validated structured interviews. Weighted analyses were carried out accounting for the two-phase methodology to obtain prevalence figures and to carry out risk factor regression analyses. RESULTS:  By mid-life, 15.3\% (95\% confidence intervals, 13.5-17.4\%) of women had met criteria for a lifetime ED. The 12-month prevalence of EDs was 3.6\%. Childhood sexual abuse was prospectively associated with all binge/purge type disorders and an external locus of control was associated with binge-eating disorder. Better maternal care was protective for bulimia nervosa. Childhood life events and interpersonal sensitivity were associated with all EDs. CONCLUSIONS:  By mid-life a significant proportion of women will experience an ED, and few women accessed healthcare. Active EDs are common in mid-life, both due to new onset and chronic disorders. Increased awareness of the full spectrum of EDs in this stage of life and adequate service provision is important. This is the first study to investigate childhood and personality risk factors for full threshold and sub-threshold EDs and to identify common predictors for full and sub-threshold EDs. Further research should clarify the role of preventable risk factors on both full and sub-threshold EDs.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:  The current study informed the definition of "excessive exercise" by examining relations between exercise behavior, eating-disordered behavior, and quality of life (QOL) in a community sample of women. METHOD:  Self-report measures of frequency of exercise, obligatory exercise and motivation for exercise, and of eating disorder psychopathology and QOL, were completed by 3,472 women aged 18-42 years who engaged in regular exercise. RESULTS:  The extent to which exercise is intended to influence weight or shape and the degree to which guilt is experienced when exercise is postponed were the exercise variables most strongly associated with elevated levels of eating disorder psychopathology and reduced QOL. Subgroups of participants who reported exercising solely for weight and shape reasons (n = 322 [9.3\%]), intense guilt after postponement of exercise (n = 136 [3.9\%]), or both (n = 116 [3.3\%]), had markedly elevated levels of eating disorder psychopathology. There was no association between excessive exercise and reduced QOL after the effects of eating disorder psychopathology were statistically controlled. CONCLUSION:  The findings suggest that exercise is excessive when its postponement is accompanied by intense guilt or when it is undertaken solely to influence weight or shape. Operational definitions of excessive exercise might usefully include reference to these terms. The findings may also be of benefit in informing the content of prevention programs, which address dysfunctional exercise behavior. Excessive exercise is unlikely to be associated with impairment in psychosocial functioning in the absence of eating disorder psychopathology. It may, however, be a useful indicator of such psychopathology.},

This prompted a large-scale and systematic examination of the impact of CE in a representative ED sample. Methods: CE was examined in over 9000 female and male patients from a clinical ED database (covering out-patient, day and/or residential treatment) with respect to prevalence, ED diagnosis, ED symptoms, clinical features, patient characteristics, and outcome at 1-year follow-up. Relationships between changes in CE behavior and remission were also examined. Results: CE was a transdiagnostic symptom, present in nearly half of all patients (48\%). It was associated with greater overall ED pathology, particularly dietary restraint, and negative perfectionism. Initial CE did not impact remission rate, but patients continuing or starting CE during treatment had considerably lower remission rates compared to patients who never engaged in, or ceased with, CE. Results were comparable for females and males. Conclusions: At baseline, there were few differences between patients with and without CE, except a somewhat higher symptom load for patients with CE, and CE did not predict ED outcome. However, how CE developed during treatment to 1-year follow-up considerably impacted remission rates. We strongly recommend CE to be systematically assessed, addressed, and continuously evaluated in all ED patients seeking treatment.},

The current study examined the factor analytic structure of anxiety sensitivity in a large sample of normal adolescents (N=518) using the revised childhood anxiety sensitivity index (CASI-R). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that anxiety sensitivity as measured by the CASI-R can best be conceptualised as a hierarchical construct with four lower-order factors loading on a single higher-order factor. The lower-order factors were `fear of cardiovascular symptoms', `fear of publicly observable anxiety reactions', `fear of cognitive dyscontrol', and `fear of respiratory symptoms'. An additional aim of the present study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the CASI-R. Results showed the CASI-R to be a reliable scale in terms of internal consistency. Furthermore, CASI-R scores were substantially related to levels of anxiety sensitivity as measured by the original index, trait anxiety, symptoms of anxiety disorders, in particular `panic disorder and agoraphobia', and depression. Finally, some evidence was found for the validity of the CASI-R factor scores. That is, all factors convincingly loaded on symptoms of `panic disorder and agoraphobia', whereas the factor `fear of publicly observable anxiety reactions' was also strongly associated with symptoms of `social phobia'.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To examine this idea, we identified 184 independent data sets from studies that utilized self-determination theory (SDT; Deci \& Ryan, 2000) in health care and health promotion contexts. A meta-analysis evaluated relations between the SDT-based constructs of practitioner support for patient autonomy and patients? experience of psychological need satisfaction, as well as relations between these SDT constructs and indices of mental and physical health. Results showed the expected relations among the SDT variables, as well as positive relations of psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivation to beneficial health outcomes. Several variables (e.g., participants? age, study design) were tested as potential moderators when effect sizes were heterogeneous. Finally, we used path analyses of the meta-analyzed correlations to test the interrelations among the SDT variables. Results suggested that SDT is a viable conceptual framework to study antecedents and outcomes of motivation for health-related behaviors.}

  abstract = {A growing body of literature suggests that post-secondary students experience food insecurity (FI) at greater rates than the general population. However, these rates vary dramatically across institutions and studies. FI assessment methods commonly used in studies with college students have not been scrutinized for psychometric properties, and varying protocols may influence resulting FI prevalence estimates. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of standard food security assessment protocols and to evaluate their agreement as well as the relative accuracy of these protocols in identifying student FI. A randomized sample of 4,000 undergraduate students were invited to participate in an online survey (Qualtrics, LLC, Provo, Utah, USA) that evaluated sociodemographic characteristics and FI with the 2-item food sufficiency screener and the 10-item USDA Adult Food Security Survey Module (FSSM; containing the abbreviated 6-item module). Four hundred sixty-two eligible responses were included in the final sample. The psychometric analysis revealed inconsistencies in college student response patterns on the FSSM when compared to national evaluations. Agreement between FI protocols was generally high ({$>$}90\%) but was lessened when compared with a protocol that incorporated the 2-item screener. The 10-item FSSM with the 2-item screener had the best model fit (McFadden's R2 = 0.15 and Bayesian Information Criterion = -2049.72) and emerged as the tool providing the greatest relative accuracy for identifying students with FI. Though the 10-item FSSM and 2-item screener yields the most accuracy in this sample, it is unknown why students respond to FSSM items differently than the general population. Further qualitative and quantitative evaluations are needed to determine which assessment protocol is the most valid and reliable for use in accurately identifying FI in post-secondary students across the U.S.},

  abstract = {Reports of college students experiencing food insecurity (FI), defined as inadequate access, availability, adequacy, and stability of food, have sparked national calls for alleviation and prevention policies. However, there are a wide variety of FI rates reported across studies and even among recent literature reviews. The current scoping review aimed to develop a weighted estimated prevalence of FI among US students using a comprehensive search approach. In addition, study characteristics that may be related to the high variability in reported FI prevalence were explored. To address these aims, the peer-reviewed and gray literature on US college student FI was systematically searched to identify 12,044 nonduplicated records. A total of 51 study samples, across 62 records, met inclusion criteria and were included in the current review. The quality of the included studies was moderate, with an average rate of 6.4 on a scale of 0\textendash 10. Convenience (45\%) and census (30\%) sampling approaches were common; only 4 study samples were based on representative sampling strategies. FI estimates ranged from 10\% to 75\%. It was common for very low security to be as prevalent as, or more prevalent than, low food security. The surveying protocols used in the studies were related to the FI estimates. The USDA Short Form Food Security Survey Module (FSSM; 50\%) and the USDA Adult FSSM (40\%) prevalence estimates were larger than for the full USDA Household FSSM (13\%). When these surveys referenced a 12-mo period, FI estimates were 31\%. This was a lower FI estimate than surveys using reference periods of 9 mo or shorter (47\%). The results indicate that FI is a pressing issue among college students, but the variation in prevalence produced by differing surveys suggests that students may be misclassified with current surveying methods. Psychometric testing of these surveys when used with college students is warranted.},

Psychosocial factors may put people at greater risk for engaging in maladaptive exercise. Based on deviance regulation theory, weight bias was examined as a potential moderator of the association between exercise identity and both excessive exercise and muscle-building behaviors. Design The current study is a secondary analysis of a larger data set investigating associations between athletic identity, exercise behaviors, and disordered eating behaviors. Hypotheses were examined using moderation testing in multiple linear regression. Main outcome measures Participants (N~=~225, 50.2\% female) completed the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory as a measure of maladaptive exercise. Results Controlling for sex, age, athlete status, and body mass index, weight bias moderated the association between exercise identity and both excessive exercise and muscle-building behaviors. Among individuals with high exercise identity, higher weight bias was associated with increased maladaptive exercise behaviors. Conclusion Individuals with higher exercise identity and higher weight bias may be at greatest risk of engaging in maladaptive exercise. Preventive interventions for maladaptive exercise behaviors may consider targeting exercise identity and weight bias.},

Students are unable to acquire adequate food to meet their needs because of limited money, time, transportation, and other factors. However, food insecurity rates are almost always assessed by using the USDA's food security survey module, which frames the barriers to food access as purely financial by relying entirely on items that explicitly ask about a financial barrier to food security, rather than any other possible barriers. Using survey and interview data collected in collaboration with our campus food pantry and undergraduate student researchers from 2015 to 2019, we show that student food insecurity is a result of complex factors that go beyond financial limitations. We argue that the USDA measure is insufficient for fully assessing the prevalence of college student food insecurity because it presupposes a financial cause for food insecurity and then undercounts those who are food insecure for other reasons.},

Methods A web-based survey was completed by 4,732 1st year medical students from 49 medical schools as part of a longitudinal study of medical education. The survey included a validated measure of implicit weight bias, the implicit association test, and 2 measures of explicit bias: a feeling thermometer and the anti-fat attitudes test. Results A majority of students exhibited implicit (74\%) and explicit (67\%) weight bias. Implicit weight bias scores were comparable to reported bias against racial minorities. Explicit attitudes were more negative toward obese people than toward racial minorities, gays, lesbians, and poor people. In multivariate regression models, implicit and explicit weight bias was predicted by lower BMI, male sex, and non-Black race. Either implicit or explicit bias was also predicted by age, SES, country of birth, and specialty choice. Conclusions Implicit and explicit weight bias is common among 1st year medical students, and varies across student factors. Future research should assess implications of biases and test interventions to reduce their impact.},

This issue has not yet been investigated in the literature. Data were collected from 126 female patients diagnosed with ED and a total of 581 women from the general population. Our findings are highly consistent with the original single-factor structure of GFFS but only in the clinical sample. In the non-clinical sample, a good fit to the data has been achieved with a two-factor model composed of Fear of gaining weight and Fear of losing control over eating/weight. The Polish version of GFFS demonstrated good psychometric properties. It can be used as a fast screening tool to identify individuals with eating disorders and those at risk of developing such disorders. We recommend the two-factor model for non-clinical samples and the one-dimensional model for clinical samples for both research and practice.},

Although perfectionism is thought to contribute to the development of psychopathology and the MPS-F is gaining popularity for use in assessing perfectionism in clinical samples, to date the factor structure has not been examined in a clinical sample. Three hundred and twenty-two individuals diagnosed with an anxiety disorder using the SCID for DSM-IV and 49 nonclinical controls completed the MPS-F as well as a measure of perfectionism (MPS-H) developed by Hewitt and Flett (1991). Analyses suggested that the MPS-F has similar psychometric properties in clinical samples to those in nonclinical samples, and factors very similar to those observed by Frost et al. (1990) could be extracted. A 3-factor solution appeared more appropriate for statistical reasons, and the 3 scales based on these factors distinguished among diagnostic groups in a manner similar to scales based on the 6-factor solution in past research. Results were discussed in terms of the potential utility of a 3-factor solution and in terms of the general construct of perfectionism and the distinction between nonpathological high performance standards and neurotic perfectionism. \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

While the impact of sociocultural influences on disordered eating has been identified in young people, sociocultural influences on compulsive exercise are yet to be systematically synthesized. This systematic review therefore aimed to synthesize literature examining sociocultural influences from peers, family and media on compulsive exercise, to explore the potential importance of such influences on the development and maintenance of compulsive exercise in young people. A systematic literature search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science databases up to November 2021. Seven quantitative studies were included (five cross-sectional, two prospective). The review highlighted three key factors underpinning the relationship between sociocultural influences and compulsive exercise in young people: body-related messages from significant others, and unfavorable comparisons with, and pressure to conform to, body image ideals. The findings support the notion that compulsive exercise behaviors and attitudes can be socially determined. However, the limited research with young people necessitates further exploration of sociocultural influences on the development and onset of compulsive exercise in adolescence/young adulthood to develop robust conclusions. It is also crucial that research remains up to date with changing technological influences on exercise behaviors.},

Method Sixty-five children with OCD (25 girls and 40 boys, aged 8 to 17 years) were assessed with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). Interrater agreement was assessed by four raters in a subsample (n = 24). Discriminant and convergent validity were assessed by comparing CY-BOCS scores to self-ratings of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Results Internal consistency was high, measuring .87 for the 10 items. The intraclass correlations for the CY-BOCS Total, Obsession, and Compulsion scores were .84, .91, and .66, suggesting good to excellent interrater agreement for subscale and total scores. The CY-BOCS Total score showed a significantly higher correlation with a self-report of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (r = .62 for the Leyton survey) compared with the Children's Depression Inventory (r = .34) and the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (r = .37) (p = .02 and .05, respectively). Conclusions The CY-BOCS yields reliable and valid subscale and total scores for obsessive-compulsive symptom severity in children and adolescents with OCD. Reliability and validity appear to be influenced by age of the child and the hazards associated with integrating data from parental and patient sources.},

  abstract = {The Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-3 (SATAQ-3) and its earlier versions are measures designed to assess societal and interpersonal aspects of appearance ideals. Correlational, structural equation modeling, and prospective studies of the SATAQ-3 have shown consistent and significant associations with measures of body image disturbance and eating pathology. In the current investigation, the SATAQ-3 was revised to improve upon some conceptual limitations and was evaluated in 4 U.S. and 3 international female samples, as well as a U.S. male sample. In Study 1, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses for a sample of women from the Southeastern United States (N = 859) indicated a 22-item scale with 5 factors: Internalization: Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization: Muscular/Athletic, Pressures: Family, Pressures: Media, Pressures: Peers. This scale structure was confirmed in 3 independent and geographically diverse samples of women from the United States (East Coast N = 440, West Coast N = 304, and North/Midwest N = 349). SATAQ-4 scale scores demonstrated excellent reliability and good convergent validity with measures of body image, eating disturbance, and self-esteem. Study 2 replicated the factorial validity, reliability, and convergent validity of the SATAQ-4 in an international sample of women drawn from Italy, England, and Australia (N = 362). Study 3 examined a sample of college males from the United States (N = 271); the 5-factor solution was largely replicated, yet there was some evidence of an underlying structure unique to men. Future research avenues include additional item testing and modification of the scale for men, as well as adaptation of the measure for children and adolescents.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Sociocultural Attitudes Toward Appearance Questionnaire-4 (SATAQ-4) is a measure of internalization of appearance ideals (i.e., personal acceptance of societal ideals) and appearance pressures (i.e., pressures to achieve the societal ideal). The current study sought to address limitations of the scale in order to increase precision in the measurement of muscular ideal internalization, include an assessment of one's desire for attractiveness, and broaden the measurement of appearance-related pressures. METHOD: The factor structure, reliability and construct validity of the SATAQ-4-Revised were examined among college women (N\,=\,1,114) in Study 1, adolescent girls (N\,=\,275) in Study 2, and college men (N\,=\,290) in Study 3. RESULTS: Factor analysis among college women indicated a 7-factor 31-item scale, labeled the SATAQ-4R-Female: (1) Internalization: Thin/Low Body Fat, (2) Internalization: Muscular, (3) Internalization: General Attractiveness, (4) Pressures: Family, (5) Pressures: Media, (6) Pressures: Peers, and (7) Pressures: Significant Others. SATAQ-4R-Female subscales demonstrated good reliability and construct validity among college women. Examination of the SATAQ-4R-Female among adolescent girls suggested a six-factor scale in which peer and significant others items comprised a single subscale. The scale demonstrated good reliability and construct validity in adolescent girls. Examination of the SATAQ-4R among men produced a 28-item scale with seven factors paralleling the factors identified among college women. This scale, labeled the SATAQ-4R-Male, demonstrated good reliability and construct validity. DISCUSSION: Results support the reliability and validity of SATAQ-4R-Female in college women and adolescent girls, and the SATAQ-4R-Male in college men. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.(Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:104-117).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Maladaptive exercise relates to eating disorder (ED) pathology and impairment in clinical and non-clinical populations. At present, two different conceptualizations of maladaptive exercise are often studied in relation to ED pathology: compulsive exercise and exercise dependence. Compulsive exercise functions to avoid negative affect (e.g., guilt and anxiety) associated with not exercising, whereas exercise dependence is associated with tolerance to exercise benefits and avoidance of exercise withdrawal. At present, clinicians and researchers struggle to determine the most appropriate term for describing problematic exercise in individuals with ED pathology. This study aimed to directly compare these conceptualizations of maladaptive exercise in relation to severity of ED pathology. DESIGN: This study examined cross-sectional data. METHOD: Undergraduate participants (N =235, 78\% female) with elevated ED pathology completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Compulsive Exercise Test (CET), and Exercise Dependence Scale (EDS). Multiple linear regression analyses evaluated associations between EDE-Q and CET and EDS scores and dominance analysis determined which qualities of exercise were uniquely associated with EDE-Q scores. RESULTS: Results suggest that compulsive qualities of exercise, including exercise to control shape and weight and to avoid negative affect are more strongly associated with severity of ED pathology than qualities of exercise dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and researchers working with ED populations can benefit from prioritizing assessments that capture compulsive qualities of exercise. Additionally, these results suggest that interventions that effectively target other compulsive behaviors (e.g., exposure and response prevention) may be promising treatment options for problematic exercise in the context of EDs.},

The current study clarifies processes that influence exercise-related risk in adolescence and young adulthood, including the frequency with which young people transition between engaging in exercise for weight loss and experiencing negative consequences of this behavior. Method: Participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) reported on eating disorder (ED) cognitions at age 14, and exercise behavior at ages 14, 16, 18, and 24 years old. Analyses examined rates of transition between the categories of `No Exercise for Weight Loss', `Exercise for Weight Loss' and `Maladaptive Exercise' over time, identified overall trends in endorsement of exercise for weight loss and maladaptive exercise, and clarified initial predictors of these behaviors. Results: Endorsement of exercise for weight loss and maladaptive exercise increased over time in both boys and girls. Those in the `Exercise for Weight Loss' category were more likely than those in the `No Exercise for Weight Loss Category' to transition to `Maladaptive Exercise' over time. Body mass index (BMI; Age 13) and fear of weight gain (Age 14) were consistent predictors of maladaptive exercise across gender. Conclusions: Results support re-framing motivations for exercise in youth away from weight loss at a population level and targeting reductions in fear of weight gain for high-risk individuals.},

The current study investigated prospective associations between neuropsychological functioning in childhood (ages 8 and 10) and ED behaviours and disorders in adolescence (at ages 14, 16, and 18 years) in a population-based sample. Method Participants (N = 4,803) were children enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a population-based, prospective study of women and their children. Regression methods tested associations between facets of neuropsychological functioning (attention, working memory, and inhibition) and eating disorder symptoms and diagnoses. Results Better scores on working memory tasks in childhood were associated with decreased risk of fasting but increased risk of excessive exercise during adolescence. Better inhibitory control was associated with decreased risk for disordered eating at age 14, and attentional difficulties were associated with increased risk for binge eating disorder during adolescence among boys but not girls. Conclusions Neuropsychological functioning may enhance risk for disordered eating behaviours in specific ways. Overall, effect sizes were small, and results did not support global associations between neuropsychological differences and ED risk in this sample.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Dysfunctional exercise is a common, debilitating symptom across eating disorders (ED). We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between experiences of exercise and ED behaviors and cognitions in an adolescent, population-based sample. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 4,054) self-reported whether they exercised to control shape and weight (exercise for weight loss [EWL]), and, if so, whether they exercised even when injured, and whether exercise interfered with life functioning (driven exercise) at age 14 years, allowing delineation of three exercise-based groups: no-EWL, EWL, and driven exercise. Participants also reported ED cognitions at age 14 years along with other ED behaviors (fasting, purging, binge eating) at ages 14 and 16 years. Sex-stratified regression approaches were employed to examine relationships between these exercise categories at age 14 and ED behaviors and cognitions at ages 14 and 16. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, those in the driven exercise group, compared to the no-EWL group, consistently reported higher levels of ED cognitions and behaviors, with those in the EWL group also reporting higher levels of some ED cognitions and behaviors relative to the no-EWL group. Those in the EWL and driven exercise groups at age 14 also demonstrated a higher prospective likelihood of fasting (boys and girls) and purging (girls only) at age 16, relative to those in the no-EWL group at age 14. DISCUSSION: Results inform our understanding of EWL and driven exercise and the developmental timing of ED behaviors in adolescence and point toward the potential utility of targeted prevention for young people who report EWL.},

This trait has been studied extensively among animal models of activity anorexia nervosa (AN) and may hold particular interest as an endophenotype for AN. We explored features associated with excessive exercise across subtypes of eating disorders. METHOD:  Participants were female probands and affected female relatives from the multi-site international Price Foundation Genetic Studies with diagnoses of AN, bulimia nervosa (BN), and both AN and BN or eating disorder not otherwise specified (ED-NOS) (N=1,857). Excessive exercise was defined based on responses to the Structured Interview for Anorexic and Bulimic Disorders (SIAB). RESULTS:  Among the eating disorder diagnostic groups, excessive exercise was most common among the purging subtype of AN. Individuals who reported excessive exercise also reported lower minimum BMI, younger age at interview, higher scores on anxiety, perfectionism, and eating disorder symptom measures, more obsessions and compulsions, and greater persistence. CONCLUSION:  Excessive exercise may be associated particularly with the purging subtype of AN as well as with a constellation of anxious/obsessional temperament and personality characteristics among women with eating disorders.},

Study 2 tested the prospective association between over-exercise and acquired capability for suicide (ACS) in a sample of 171 college students followed for 3-4 weeks. Study 3 investigated whether pain insensitivity accounted for the relationship between over-exercise and ACS in a new sample of 467 college students. Study 4 tested whether ACS accounted for the relationship between over-exercise and suicidal behavior in a sample of 512 college students. In Study 1, after controlling for key covariates, over-exercise was the only disordered eating variable that maintained a significant relationship with suicidal behavior. In Study 2, Time 1 over-exercise was the only disordered eating behavior that was associated with Time 2 ACS. In Study 3, pain insensitivity accounted for the relationship between over-exercise and ACS. In Study 4, ACS accounted for the relationship between over-exercise and suicidal behavior. Over-exercise appears to be associated with suicidal behavior, an association accounted for by pain insensitivity and the acquired capability for suicide; notably, this association was found across a series of four studies with different populations.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to describe the exercise behavior across the DSM-IV eating disorder diagnosis (anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)) and determine if differences exist among exercise category (high level and low level), type of exercise (aerobic, strength, and total), Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-2), and the length of inpatient hospitalization. This study was a retrospective analysis of 199 inpatient hospital records of female patients (age M=20.6, S.D.=7.03) in the following diagnostic categories: AN (n=115, 58\%), BN (n=38, 19\%), and EDNOS (n=46, 23\%). Patients were also grouped by a median split into low- and high-level exercise categories based on their total amount of weekly exercise. No significant relationship was found between diagnosis and exercise category (high and low) or diagnosis and exercise type (total, aerobic, and strength exercise). This is valuable because exercise specialist may be a worthwhile addition to treatment teams working with all eating disorder diagnostic groups. The high-level exercisers showed significantly greater scores on the EAT [F(2,1,110)=5.117, P{$<$}.05] and weight preoccupation [F(1,1010)=4.861, P{$<$}.05] than the low-level exercise groups. There were significant relationships between total exercise and EAT (r=.354, P{$<$}.01), drive for thinness (r=.262, P{$<$}.01), and body dissatisfaction (r=.312, P{$<$}.001). Total aerobic exercise was significantly related to EAT (r=.352, P{$<$}.001), drive for thinness (r=.272, P{$<$}.01), and body dissatisfaction (r=.268, P{$<$}.01). Finally, total strength exercise was related to body dissatisfaction (r=.249, P{$<$}.05). A significant difference was found among exercise group and length of hospitalization [F(1,155)=14.384, P{$<$}.000]. The high-level exercisers were in treatment for 3 weeks longer than their low-level exercisers. A forced stepwise multiple linear regression was calculated to predict the length of hospitalization. At Step 1, diagnosis and Body Mass Index (BMI) on admission explained 27\% of the variance in length of inpatient hospitalization [F(4,154)=18.08, P{$<$}.004, r(2)=.273]. When two exercise variables were included, aerobic activity explained an additional 5\% of variance, whereas strength activity explained an additional 0.3\% of the variance. Three-fourths of the predictors explained significant components of the total 32\% variance. The present study demonstrates that patients with greater total exercise and a greater total aerobic exercise show a significantly greater drive for thinness and require a longer length of hospitalization. This association was not present with total strength exercise levels. Effective clinical methods to modify total aerobic exercise levels need to be determined with inpatient populations.}

  abstract = {Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity.A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use.A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89\%) and specificity (82\%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale.The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.Arch Intern Med. 2006;166:1092-1097--{$>$}},

Method This study was a community participatory three-site, two-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). Female collegiate athletes (N = 481) were randomly assigned by team to the FAB intervention, a behavioral ED risk factor reduction program, or a waitlist control condition. Primary analyses examined 18-month effects for ED pathology. Secondary analyses examined risk factors and correlates (e.g., thin-ideal internalization, negative mood, Female Athlete Triad knowledge, and body mass index [BMI]). Results Linear mixed effects models with team as a cluster level variable and study condition as a between-subjects variable revealed significantly reduced dietary restraint in FAB teams relative to control teams. FAB teams also reported significantly fewer objective and subjective binge episodes than control teams. Finally, FAB teams showed significantly lower thin-ideal internalization and increased BMI at 18-months. No other significant differences were found. Discussion This RCT examined the effects of a short intervention on ED pathology and risk factors in female collegiate athletes through 18-month follow-up. This trial is one of only three trials with female athletes that have shown long-term reductions in any ED symptoms or produced positive effects on ED risk factors. The present study is the first to find such effects with athletes using a brief (i.e., 4 hr) intervention at 18-month follow-up. Although small effects were found, the current trial provides valuable lessons about future design and implementation of similar trials with athletes.

Method 680 young women (M age = 22.2, SD = 7.1) recruited at colleges in 2 states were randomized to clinician-led Body Project groups, peer-led Body Project groups, the Internet-based eBody Project or an educational video control condition. Results Participants in all three variants of the Body Project intervention showed significantly greater reductions in eating disorder risk factors and symptoms than educational video controls. Participants in clinician-led and peer-led Body Project groups showed significantly greater reductions in risk factors than eBody Project participants, but effects for the two types of groups were similar. Eating disorder onset over 7-month follow-up was significantly lower for peer-led Body Project group participants versus eBody Project participants (2.2\% vs. 8.4\%), but did not differ significantly between other conditions. Conclusions The evidence that all three dissonance-based prevention programs outperformed an educational video condition, that both group-based interventions outperformed the Internet-based intervention in risk factor reductions, and that the peer-led groups showed lower eating disorder onset over follow-up than the Internet-based intervention is novel. These acute-effects data suggest that both group-based interventions produce superior eating disorder prevention effects than the Internet-based intervention and that delivery can be task-shifted to peer leaders.},

This meta-analytic review characterized the average intervention effects and tested whether various intervention, participant, and facilitator features correlated with larger effects to guide implementation of optimally effective versions of this program. We identified 56 trials that evaluated 68 dissonance-based eating disorder prevention programs (7808 participants). Average intervention effect sizes (d) relative to minimal intervention control conditions and credible alternative interventions (respectively) were 0.57 and 0.31 for thin-ideal internalization, 0.42 and 0.18 for body dissatisfaction, 0.37 and 0.17 for dieting, 0.29 and 0.21 for negative affect, and 0.31 and 0.13 for eating disorder symptoms. As hypothesized, effects were larger for interventions with more dissonance-inducing activities, more group sessions, and larger group sizes, as well as when delivered in-person versus on-line, sessions were recorded, participation was voluntary, body dissatisfaction was required, participants were mid-adolescents or adults (versus older adolescence), there were more ethnic minority participants, groups were led by clinicians versus researchers and at least two facilitators, and when facilitators received more training and supervision. Unexpectedly from a dissonance-induction perspective, effects were larger when participants were compensated. Results offer directions for maximizing the benefits of implementation efforts with dissonancebased eating disorder prevention programs, and may hold lessons for preventing other public health problems with dissonance-based interventions.},

Physical activity (PA) and exercise training (ET) are associated with reduced CV risk, improved cardiometabolic risk factors, and facilitated weight loss through creating a negative energy balance. Clinicians need to counsel overweight and obese patients on how much PA/ET is needed to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance. This will help establish realistic expectations and maximize improvements in CV risk factors. Although the minimum guidelines for aerobic PA (150\,min of moderate or 75\,min of vigorous physical activity per week) can improve CV health, these levels are generally inadequate for clinically significant weight loss or weight maintenance without caloric restriction. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the role of ET to promote clinically significant weight loss and promote weight maintenance. In particular, we will evaluate the likelihood of weight loss from ET programs composed of aerobic training only, resistance training only and programs that combine diet and ET. We will also explore the role of PA in promoting short-term and long-term weight maintenance.},

Results Factor analyses yielded five factors from which a final 24-item, five subscale measure was constructed. The CET demonstrated high internal consistency across the three samples. Supporting the concurrent and convergent validity of the scale, the CET correlated in the expected direction with existing measures of excessive exercise and eating pathology. As expected, the CET explained greater variance in eating pathology than existing measures of excessive exercise. Discussion The resulting subscales of the CET are consistent with a cognitive-behavioural maintenance model of excessive exercise and support the multidimensionality of the excessive exercise construct.

Study 2 was a systematic replication of Study 1 using different indices of body image and a more comprehensive assessment of eating disturbance. In Study 3, subjects from Study 1 were reassessed at a 3-year follow-up. Results: The findings from Study 1 indicated that level of obesity and perceived weight, but not maturational timing, had a directional influence on the other variables. In addition, teasing history was significantly related to the development of body image and eating disturbance.

  abstract = {Background Genetic factors contribute to anorexia nervosa (AN); and the first genome-wide significant locus has been identified. We describe methods and procedures for the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI), an international collaboration designed to rapidly recruit 13,000 individuals with AN and ancestrally matched controls. We present sample characteristics and the utility of an online eating disorder diagnostic questionnaire suitable for large-scale genetic and population research. Methods ANGI recruited from the United States (US), Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Sweden (SE), and Denmark (DK). Recruitment was via national registers (SE, DK); treatment centers (US, ANZ, SE, DK); and social and traditional media (US, ANZ, SE). All cases had a lifetime AN diagnosis based on DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria (excluding amenorrhea). Recruited controls had no lifetime history of disordered eating behaviors. To assess the positive and negative predictive validity of the online eating disorder questionnaire (ED100K-v1), 109 women also completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Module H. Results Blood samples and clinical information were collected from 13,363 individuals with lifetime AN and from controls. Online diagnostic phenotyping was effective and efficient; the validity of the questionnaire was acceptable. Conclusions Our multi-pronged recruitment approach was highly effective for rapid recruitment and can be used as a model for efforts by other groups. High online presence of individuals with AN rendered the Internet/social media a remarkably effective recruitment tool in some countries. ANGI has substantially augmented Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN sample collection. ANGI is a registered clinical trial: clinicaltrials.govNCT01916538; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01916538?cond=Anorexia+Nervosa\&draw=1\&rank=3.},

  abstract = {Objective The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of information accumulated over the past 26 years regarding the psychometric properties and utility of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Participants The reviewed studies assessed a wide variety of subjects, ranging from cognitively intact community residents to those with severe cognitive impairment associated with various types of dementing illnesses. Main Outcome Measures The validity of the MMSE was compared against a variety of gold standards, including DSM-III-R and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, clinical diagnoses, Activities of Daily Living measures, and other tests that putatively identify and measure cognitive impairment. Results Reliability and construct validity were judged to be satisfactory. Measures of criterion validity showed high levels of sensitivity for moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment and lower levels for mild degrees of impairment. Content analyses revealed the MMSE was highly verbal, and not all items were equally sensitive to cognitive impairment. Items measuring language were judged to be relatively easy and lacked utility for identifying mild language deficits. Overall, MMSE scores were affected by age, education, and cultural background, but not gender. Conclusions In general, the MMSE fulfilled its original goal of providing a brief screening test that quantitatively assesses the severity of cognitive impairment and documents cognitive changes occurring over time. The MMSE should not, by itself, be used as a diagnostic tool to identify dementia. Suggestions for the clinical use of the MMSE are made.},

Oxford: Oxford University Press; 1982] has described two motivational systems, the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) and the Behavioural Activation System (BAS), that control aversive and appetitive behaviour, respectively. Research on Gray's model of personality has been hindered by the lack of specific self-report measures of the reactivity and responsivity of these systems. We describe a set of studies that illustrate the main psychometrical characteristics of the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ).

Results showed that both scales were independent, and presented satisfactory internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Studies 2\textendash 5 reported data related to convergent and discriminant validity of the scales. The Sensitivity to Punishment scale was: (1) positively related to Eysenck's neuroticism dimension; (2) negatively related to extraversion; (3) not related to psychoticism; (4) significantly related to the STAI-Trait scale of Spielberger; and (5) related to the somatic, behavioral, and cognitive anxiety scales of Lehrer and Woolfolk [Behavioral Assessment, 4, (1982) 167\textendash 177.]. The Sensitivity to Reward scale was: (1) positively related to Eysenck's extraversion and neuroticism; (2) moderately related to psychoticism; (3) positively related to the Eysenck's Impulsiveness scale [Psychological Reports, 43, (1978) 1247\textendash 1255] and the Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scales [Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 46, (1978) 139\textendash 149].

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe physical activity levels of children (6-11 yr), adolescents (12-19 yr), and adults (20+ yr), using objective data obtained with accelerometers from a representative sample of the U.S. population. METHODS: These results were obtained from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), a cross-sectional study of a complex, multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population in the United States. Data are described from 6329 participants who provided at least 1 d of accelerometer data and from 4867 participants who provided four or more days of accelerometer data. RESULTS: Males are more physically active than females. Physical activity declines dramatically across age groups between childhood and adolescence and continues to decline with age. For example, 42\% of children ages 6-11 yr obtain the recommended 60 min x d(-1) of physical activity, whereas only 8\% of adolescents achieve this goal. Among adults, adherence to the recommendation to obtain 30 min x d(-1) of physical activity is less than 5\%. CONCLUSIONS: Objective and subjective measures of physical activity give qualitatively similar results regarding gender and age patterns of activity. However, adherence to physical activity recommendations according to accelerometer-measured activity is substantially lower than according to self-report. Great care must be taken when interpreting self-reported physical activity in clinical practice, public health program design and evaluation, and epidemiological research.},

A national cross-sectional sample of 4-year colleges in the United States. Setting. Ninety-four 4-year colleges in the United States. Subjects. A total of 14,804 undergraduate students. Measures. Self-report vigorous physical activity, perceived stress (measured using the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale), mental health (measured using the SF-36), and socializing (assessed using self-report number of friends and hours spent socializing). Analysis. Logistic regression models accounting for clustering within schools were estimated to examine the association between vigorous physical activity, mental health, perceived stress, and socializing. Adjusted models included high school vigorous physical activity and sociodemographic characteristics. Results. Students who met vigorous physical activity recommendations were less likely to report poor mental health (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: .79; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: .69, .90) and perceived stress (adjusted OR: .75; 95\% CI: .67, .83) than students who did not meet recommendations. In addition, socializing partially mediated the relationship between vigorous physical activity, mental health, and perceived stress; however, race and sex did not moderate the relationship. Conclusion. Interventions aiming to improve mental well-being of college students should also consider promoting physical activity. At least some of the positive benefits of physical activity may arise from social interactions.}

We propose that the most dangerous form of suicidal desire is caused by the simultaneous presence of two interpersonal constructs\textemdash thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness (and hopelessness about these states)\textemdash and further, that the capability to engage in suicidal behavior is separate from the desire to engage in suicidal behavior. According to the theory, the capability for suicidal behavior emerges, via habituation and opponent processes, in response to repeated exposure to physically painful and/or fear-inducing experiences. In the current paper, the theory's hypotheses are more precisely delineated than in previous presentations (), with the aim of inviting scientific inquiry and potential falsification of the theory's hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Exercise and sports activity is beneficial both physically and psychologically but excessive exercise may have adverse physiological and psychological effects. There are methodological issues in the definition, diagnosis and etiology of exercise addiction. Several questionnaires and diagnostic tools have been developed and validated and they show high validity and reliability. Exercise addiction has been suggested as having an obsessive-compulsive dimension as well as rewarding aspects that may include it among the behavioral addictions. Biological studies show that in rodents, exercise such as wheel running activates the dopamine reward system and thus contributing to stress reduction. Further evidence suggests that running is associated with endorphins and cannabinoids thus explaining the "runners high" or euphoric feelings that may lead to exercise addiction. Genetic studies suggest that genes that control preference for drugs also control the preference for naturally rewarding behaviors such as exercise. Psychological studies also explain exercise addiction in terms of reward, habituation, social support, stress-relief, avoidance of withdrawal and reduction of anxiety. It has been suggested that exercise addiction is a part of a continuum of sportive activity that develops in stages from the recreational exercise to at-risk exercise, problematic exercise and finally into exercise addiction. Assessment and treatment should take into account the various stages of exercise addiction development, its comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as eating disorders or substance use and alcohol disorders. Treatment approaches for exercise addiction are based on the cognitive-behavioral approach but little is known about their effectiveness. A single-case study shows promise of pharmacological treatment for exercise addiction and further studies are required. This review summarizes diagnostic and phenomenology of exercise addiction with emphasis on physiological and neuro-pharmacological mechanisms responsible for its rewarding and addictive properties.}

In order to build the nomological network surrounding this scale, the UPPS was administered to individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), pathological gamblers (PG), alcohol abusers (divided into two groups based on the presence of antisocial features), and a control group. Several of the UPPS scales (e.g. Urgency, lack of Premeditation, and Sensation Seeking) differentiated the BPD, PG, and alcohol abusers with antisocial features from a group of non?antisocial alcohol abusers and a control group. Overall, the UPPS scales accounted for between 7\% (pathological gambling) and 64\% (borderline personality disorder features) of the overall variance in the psychopathology measures. Individual UPPS scales also made unique contributions to several of these disorders, which may provide insight into which of these personality traits may predispose individuals to behave in maladaptive or problematic ways. The results provide support for the differentiation of impulsivity?related constructs into the current four?factor model. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The Three-Factor Model of Dieting suggests that dieting can be subdivided into three types: (1) frequency of past dieting and overeating (i.e., history of dieting), (2) current dieting to lose weight, and (3) weight suppression, or the difference between an individual's current weight and his or her highest previous weight. The purpose of this paper is to (1) describe the Dieting and Weight History Questionnaire (DWHQ), a measure that we have used for many years to assess these three dimensions of dieting; (2) provide some recent examples of published research on each type of dieting; (3) discuss some of the nuances of assessing these dieting types; and (4) suggest directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Background. Clinical, epidemiological, and genetic findings support an overlap between eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety symptoms. However, little research has examined the role of genetics in the expression of underlying phenotypes. We investigated whether the anorexia nervosa (AN), OCD, or AN/OCD transdiagnostic polygenic scores (PGS) predict eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety symptoms in a large developmental cohort in a sex-specific manner. Methods. Using summary statistics from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN and OCD genome-wide association studies, we conducted an AN/OCD transdiagnostic genome-wide association meta-analysis. We then calculated AN, OCD, and AN/OCD PGS in participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to predict eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety symptoms, stratified by sex (combined N = 3212\textendash 5369 per phenotype). Results. The PGS prediction of eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety phenotypes differed between sexes, although effect sizes were small. AN and AN/OCD PGS played a more prominent role in predicting eating disorder and anxiety risk than OCD PGS, especially in girls. AN/OCD PGS provided a small boost over AN PGS in the prediction of some anxiety symptoms. All three PGS predicted higher compulsive exercise across different developmental timepoints [{$\beta$} = 0.03 (S.E. = 0.01) for AN and AN/OCD PGS at age 14; {$\beta$} = 0.05 (S.E. = 0.02) for OCD PGS at age 16] in girls. Conclusions. Compulsive exercise may have a transdiagnostic genetic etiology, and AN genetic risk may play a role in the presence of anxiety symptoms. Converging with prior twin literature, our results also suggest that some of the contribution of genetic risk may be sex-specific.},

This study assessed the concurrent validity of the exercise items of the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) and Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), with the Compulsive Exercise Test (CET) and other self-report exercise measures in patients with AN. We also aimed to perform validation of the CET in an adult clinical sample. Methods The sample consisted of 78 adults with AN, recruited for the randomized controlled trial ``Taking a LEAP forward in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.'' At baseline, participants completed the EDE, EDE-Q, CET, Reasons for Exercise Inventory (REI), Commitment to Exercise Scale (CES) and Exercise Beliefs Questionnaire (EBQ). Correlational and regression analyses were performed. Results EDE exercise days and exercise time per day were positively correlated with each other and with all CET subscales (except Lack of exercise enjoyment), CES mean, EBQ total and REI total. Exercise time per day was associated with a higher EDE global score. The CET demonstrated good concurrent validity with the CES, the REI and the EBQ. Of the self-reports, the CET explained the greatest variance in eating disorder psychopathology and demonstrated good to excellent reliability in this sample. Discussion The EDE and EDE-Q demonstrated good concurrent validity with the CET. Further research is required to evaluate the CET's factor structure in a large clinical sample. However, the CET has demonstrated strong clinical utility in adult patients with AN. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.(Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:533\textendash 541)},

This investigation examined the prevalence of exercise-dependence symptoms among 237 college undergraduates and the relationship of exercise-dependence symptoms to atypical and disordered attitudes toward eating. Women scored significantly higher than men on the Exercise Dependence Questionnaire's (EDQ) Exercise for Weight Control and Exercise for Health Reasons subscales, and the Dieting and Bulimia and Food Preoccupation subscales of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), and exhibited significantly more symptoms of exercise dependence than men. Number of exercise-dependence symptoms was significantly positively correlated with problematic attitudes toward eating. Dysphoric mood states, cognitive problems, craving for exercise, and other symptoms associated with abstinence from exercise were relatively common among women and significantly more prevalent than among men. Study findings suggest that women with clinical and subclinical eating disorders are at high risk for the development of exercise-dependence symptoms. Findings also supported the existence of primary and secondary exercise dependence.},
